# Digital signature

This project is an application for digitally signing pdfs.

The user provides a pdf that will be signed using an Ed25519 algorithm.
Additionally, for providing a better user experience a new page will be appended
at the end of the pdf that offers visual feedback to the user that the document
was indeed signed.
