<ul>
Python code for pharmacokinetic modeling of hyperpolarized [1-13C]-pyruvate.
</ul>

<ul>
These scripts calculate the relationship between [1-13C]-pyruvate and [1-13C]-lactate, but can easily be extended to include other metabolites.
</ul>

<ul>
There are three base models, of differing complexity, which include a different number of physical compartments:
</ul>

<ul>
The scripts titled P2L3*.m describe signal evolution between two chemical pools and three physical compartments. The three-compartment model is the most physiologically accurate among these models, but it is also the most computationally intensive, requiring the largest number of descriptive parameters.
</ul>

<ul>
The scripts titled P2L2*.m are for the PK model with two chemical pools and two physical compartments. Here, HP pyruvate and lactate in the extravascular/extracellular space is assumed to be very well mixed with HP pyruvate in the intracellular space - and separate from pyr/lac in the vascular supply.
</ul>

<ul>
The scripts titled P2L1*.m represent a simple precursor-product model, which does not consider physical compartmentalization of imaging agents. Equivalently, this assumes that all compartments (vascular; extravascular/extracellular; and cellular) are well mixed.
</ul>

<ul>
Each of these groups of scripts are also accompanied by a test script (TestP2L#.m) that shows how to work with these models - from setup and generation of synthetic data to PK analysis by fitting.
