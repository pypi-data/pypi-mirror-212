##### Examples

```
> Enter the song name: pokkal pokkum -n:5 -l:tamil -b:320
(Search string - pokkal pokkum, number of results to display - 5, language - tamil, bitrate - 320kpbs)

*When a song is playing:
> Enter the song name: -q
(Displays the song queue)
> -r
(Displays the recommended song queue)
> -g
(Displays the playing song's album songs)

> -qr1 - removes the first index song from queue
> -qp1 - plays the first index song from queue
> -qa1 - adds the first index song from search list

Similar behaviors for -r (recommended songs), -g (go-to-album).
Correct prefix and actions should be used such as -rr1, -ga1, etc.

```
