Ceres, Pallas, Juno, Vesta
==========================

The orbital elements of the four main asteroids Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta
are known very precisely, because these planets have been discovered almost 200
years ago and observed very often since. On the other hand, their orbits are
not as well-determined as the ones of the main planets. We estimate that the
precision of the main asteroid ephemerides is better than 1 arc second for the
whole 20th century. The deviations from the Astronomical Almanac positions can
reach 0.5" (AA 1985 â€“ 1997). But the tables in AA are based on older
computations, whereas we used recent orbital elements. (s. AA 1997, page L14)

MPC elements have a precision of five digits with mean anomaly, perihelion,
node, and inclination and seven digits with eccentricity and semi-axis. For the
four main asteroids, this implies an uncertainty of a few arc seconds in 1600
CE and a few arc minutes in 3000 BCE.
