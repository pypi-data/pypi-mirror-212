Ceres - an application program for asteroid astrology
=====================================================

Dieter Koch has written the application program Ceres which allows to compute
all kinds of lists for asteroid astrology. E.g. you can generate a list of all
your natal asteroids ordered by position in the zodiac. But the program does
much more:

- Natal positions, synastries/transits, composite charts, progressions,
  primary directions etc.;
- Geocentric, heliocentric, topocentric, house horoscopes;
- Lists sorted by position in zodiac, by asteroid name, by declination etc.

The program is found in the Swiss Ephermeris download area in the folder
"programs".
