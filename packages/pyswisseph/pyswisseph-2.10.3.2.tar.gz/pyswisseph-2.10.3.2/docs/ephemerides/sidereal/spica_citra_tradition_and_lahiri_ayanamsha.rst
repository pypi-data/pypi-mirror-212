The "Lahiri ayanamsha" was introduced by the Indian Calendar Reform Committee
(ICRC) on the occasion of the Indian calendar reform in 1955, when the
ayanamsha based on the star Spica/Citra was declared the Indian standard. It
was used henceforth not only in astrology but also for sidereal ephemerides and
calendars published in India. However, the idea that the zodiac should be
oriented towards the star Spica (Citra in Sanskrti) is older. The Indian
astronomy historian S. B. Dixit (also written Dikshit) in his important work
History of Indian Astronomy (= Bharatiya Jyotih Shastra) in 1896 arrived at the
conclusion that, given the prominence that Vedic religion gave to the cardinal
points of the tropical year, the Indian calendar should be reformed and no
longer be calculated relative to the sidereal, but to the tropical zodiac.
However, if such a reform could not be brought about due to the rigid
conservatism of contemporary Vedic culture, then the ayanamsha should be chosen
in such a way that the sidereal zero point would be in opposition to Spica. In
this way, it would be in accordance with Grahalaghava, a work by the 16th
century astronomer Ganeśa Daivajña which was still in use in the 20th century
among Indian calendar makers. (History of Indian Astronomy, Part II, p. 323ff.).

Moreover, the Suryasiddhanta, the "standard work" of ancient Hindu astronomy,
which was written in the first centuries CE, already placed Spica/Citra at
180°. Unfortunately, this statement is in contradiction with the positions of
other stars, in particular with zeta Piscium/Revati at 359°50', which has
caused a lot of confusion.

The ayanamsha based on the star Spica/Citra became known as "Lahiri ayanamsha".
It was named after the Calcuttan astronomer and astrologer Nirmala Chandra
Lahiri (1906-1980), who was a member of the Calendar Reform Committee that in
1955 made it the standard for Hindu sidereal calendars.

The committee decreed that the ayanamsha had the value 23°15' 00" on the 21
March 1956, 0:00 Ephemeris Time. It became the basis of ayanamsha values given
in Indian Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac (IENA), in Indian Astronomical
Ephemeris (IAE), as well as for the Rashtriya Panchang
("National Calendar/Almanac"). Although not explicitly mentioned, this
ayanamsha value is true, not mean, as can be concluded from the values given
in the 5-year calendar that is included in the Report of the ICRC.

(Side note concerning the decisions of the ICRC, in the words of Vishvas Vasuki
in the Bharatiyavidvatparishat forum: "The committee created a civil solar
calendar (equinox to equinox), a religious solar calendar based on a fixed
ayanAMsha (=deviation from equinoctial colure) (23° 15') to prevent further
drift from seasons, a religious lunar calendar closely tied to the religious
solar calendar, a asterism tracking variable ayanAMsha (23° 15' 0", with annual
correction) for the nakShatra wheel. The reason for standardizing religious
calendars was to be able to determine office holidays.")

The definition of the ayanamsha was corrected in Indian Astronomical Ephemeris
1985 (see 1989, page 556, footnote):
"According to new determination of the location of equinox this initial value
has been revised to 23°15'00".658 and used in computing the mean ayanamsha with
effect from 1985'."

Exact information about the reasons for this change is unfortunately not given
or is hard to get hold of. The mention of "mean ayanamsha" is misleading,
though. Again, the value 23°15'00".658 is true ayanamsha, i.e. it includes
nutation and is relative to the true equinox of date. This must be concluded,
at least, from true ayanamsha values published in yearly editions of the Indian
Astronomical Ephemeris (IAE).

For a comparison of Lahiri ayanamsa values and sidereal ephemerides with values
given in Indian Astronomical Ephemeris, see Appendix E. TODO

Lahiri (1940) ayanamsha
=======================

:Sweph n°: ``SIDM_LAHIRI_1940`` (43)
:Ayanamsha: 22°26'45".50
:t0: J1900.0 = 31 Dec. 1899, 12:00 TT
:Note: Spica (2000) at 179°59'52"

In 1940, however, Lahiri had published a different Citra ayanamsha in his
Bengali book Panchanga Darpan. Here, the value of "mean ayanamsha" is given as
22°26'45".50 in 1900, whereas the official value for the same date is
22°27'38". With the standard Lahiri ayanamsha, the position of Spica is
"wrong", i.e. it deviates from 180° by about an arc minute, whereas with this
other ayanamsha it is almost exact. Lahiri obviously wanted to place the star
exactly at 180° for current years. The standard Lahiri position of Spica is
179°59'04 in the year 2000, and 179°59'08 in 1900. According to the definition
given in Panchanga Darpan, however calculated with rigorous precession
algorithms, the position of Spica in 2000 was 179°59'52".

The same book (Panchanga Darpan) was reprinted in 1967 and 1985, thus long
after the standard definition of the Lahiri ayanamsha had been published by the
Calendar Reform Committee. Thus, apparently, still considered this his
definition of ayanamsha more correct than the one chosen by the ICRC.

Lahiri (1972, vernal equinox 285) ayanamsha
===========================================

:Sweph n°: ``SIDM_LAHIRI_VP285`` (44)
:Ayanamsha: 0°
:t0: 22 March 285 17:54:02 TT (Lahiri original: 17:48 ET)
:Note: Spica (2000) at 179°58'35"
       mean Sun's ingress in Aries (using formulae from Simon et alii (1994))
       (true Sun's ingress was on 20 March 19:18:33 TT)

In his "Tables of the Sun", p. IX, however, which appeared in 1972, Lahiri
again gave a different definition of his ayanamsha:

"For this purpose the star Spica ( α Virginis ) has been assigned a Nirayaṇa
(i.e. sidereal; D.K.) longitude of 180°. But as the star has got proper motion,
it cannot indicate a fixed initial point for all times, even when a fixed value
of longitude is assigned to it. It has therefore been considered expedient to
adopt the vernal equinoctial point of any specified date for this purpose. The
mean equinoctial point of the mean vernal equinox day of 285 A.D., which
occurred on March 22, 17h 48m Ephemeris time or 15h 57m U.T. of that year, has
accordingly been adopted as the fixed initial point of the Sidereal or Indian
Nirayaṇa system of Astronomy."

Exactly the same initial date, however in Indian Standard Time, he gave in
1980, in the preface of his Indian Ephemeris. However, the star Spica/Citra
still does play an important part:

"The initial point of this nirayana or sidereal zodiac was the same as the
equinoctial point ... of the vernal equinox day of 285 A.D., the mean equinox
of the year occurring on Sunday March 22, 21h 27m I S.T. At that time both the
sayana (= tropical, D.K.) and the nirayana (= sidereal) longitudes of the star
Citra (Spica) were the same as 180°00'03", and the longitude of the Mean Moon
was 351°67 and of Mean Sun 360°00. It was thus a mean new-moon day also."

Thus, Lahiri actually wanted to base his ayanamsha on the mean equinox of a
"zero ayanamsha year". I.e. the zero date of his ayanamsha should be the moment
when the *mean* Sun was at zero aries tropically (mean equinox of date).
Moreover he wanted to have a mean new-moon on the same day also and the star
Citra/Spica at tropical 0° Libra/Tula exactly. (For testing, such an ayanamsha
was added to the Swiss Ephemeris as ayanamsha No. 44, ``SIDM_LAHIRI_VP285``)

However, then Lahiri continues:
"Due to proper motion of the star, the nirayana longitude of Spica has however
diminished by 65" during the period of 1695 years from 285 A.D. and now
179°58'58" according to the above ayanamsa system."

And:
"The Indian Astronomical Ephemeris of the Government of India has adopted, on
the basis of the recommendations of the Calendar Reform Committee, a value of
ayanamsa which is less by only 5".8 than the above."

Apparently, this difference was small enough for him so that he considered it
insignificant and, "for the sake of uniformity", took over the standard
ayanamsha recommended by the CRC. The ayanamsha values and sidereal positions
of the Sun and the Moon which he gives in his ephemeris are in perfect
agreement with the standard ayanamsha, not with the above-given definition.

As to the 5.8" difference, it must be added that it is only found with the
Newcomb precession model. If a modern standard model like IAU2006 or Vondrák is
used, then the difference amounts to 23".

In "Tables of the Sun", Lahiri derives an ayanamsha value of 22°27'43".5 for
"1900, Jan. 0 (= 31 Dec. 1899; D.K.), 19h 31m ET". Using a version of swetest
which calculates uses Newcomb precession (the formulation of Kinoshita 1975),
the following ayanamsha results for the same date::

    swetest -b31.12.1899 -t19:31 -p -nonut -p0 -sid44 -sidbit4096
    22°27'44.02069.

However, since Lahiri considered his zero date as essential to his ayanamsha,
the Swiss Ephemeris calculates it using the modern precession model Vondrák
2011, which for the same date provides the value 22°28' 0.90375.

From all this, it is obvious that there are several "Lahiri ayanamsha", and the
standard Lahiri ayanamsha which was adopted by the ICRC is not exactly what he
had intended.

Ayanamsha having Spica/Citra at polar longitude 180° in 499 CE
==============================================================

:Sweph n°: ``SIDM_SS_CITRA`` (26)
:Ayanamsha: 2.11070444
:t0: 21 Mar 499, 7:30:31.57 UT = noon at Ujjain, 75.7684565 E
:Note: Spica at polar ecliptic longitude 180° on equinox 499, Spica (2000)
       180°50' 3

As has been stated, the Suryasiddhanta gives the position of Spica/Citra as
180° in polar longitude (ecliptic longitude, but projection along meridian
lines).

True Chitrapaksha ayanamsha
===========================

:Sweph n°: ``SIDM_TRUE_CITRA`` (27)
:Note: Spica is always exactly at 180° or 0° Libra in ecliptic longitude
       (not polar!)

Usually ayanamshas are defined by an epoch and an initial ayanamsha offset.
However, if one wants to make sure that a particular fixed star always remains
at a precise position, e. g. Spica at 180°, it does not work this way because
the star has some proper motion and is not really fixed relative to a fixed
reference frame.

In the year 285, when the star was conjunct the autumnal equinox, its position
was 180°00'17 (``swetest -b1.1.285 -pf -xfSpica  -sid1 -true -bary -head -fTPL
-s365 -n2``). Only in the year 675 CE, its position was exactly 180°. The motion
of the star is partly caused by its proper motion. Another part of its motion
is apparent only, due to the so-called planetary precession, which causes very
slow changes in the orientation of the ecliptic plane. As can be seen from the
description of the other "Lahiri" or Spica-related ayanamshas, non of them has
Spica exactly at 180° on 1 Jan. 2000.

The correct procedure, in order to have the star at a constant position, is to
calculate the tropical position of Spica for the date and subtract it from the
tropical position of the planet.
