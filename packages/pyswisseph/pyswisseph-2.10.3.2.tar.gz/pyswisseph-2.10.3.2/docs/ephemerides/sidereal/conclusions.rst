We have found that there are basically five definitions, not counting the
manifold variations:

1. the Babylonian zodiac with Spica at 29 Virgo or Aldebaran at 15 Taurus:

    a) Fagan/Bradley
    b) refined with Aldebaran at 15 Tau
    c) P. Huber
    d) J.P. Britton

2. the Greek-Hindu-Arabic zodiac with the zero point between 10 and 20' east of
   zeta Piscium:

    e) Hipparchus
    f) Ushâshashî
    g) Sassanian
    h) true Revati ayanamsha

3. the Hindu astrological zodiac with Spica at 0 Libra:

    i) Lahiri

4. ayanamshas based on the Kaliyuga year 3600 or the 23rd year of life of
   Aryabhata.

5. galactic ayanamshas based on the position of the galactic centre or the
   galactic nodes (= intersection points of the galactic equator with the ecliptic).


No. 1) is historically the oldest one, but we are not sure about its precise
astronomical definition. It could have been Aldebaran at 15 Taurus and Antares
at 15 Scorpio.
