=======================
Krishnamurti ayanamshas
=======================

The Swiss Ephemeris also has two ayanamshas named after the Indian astrologer
K.S. Krishnamurti (1908-1972). They are very close to the Lahiri ayanamsha,
with a difference of only 4 to 5 arcmin. In fact, he says that the difference
between his ans Lahiri's ayanamsha is "negligible" (Krishnamurti, Reader 1, p.
57), but modern Hindu astrologers won't be happy with an uncertainty of several
minutes of arc.

Unfortunately, Krishnamurti did not give very precise information about the
definition of his ayanamsha (Reader 1, pp. 54-59). He says that the ayanamsha
was zero in the year 291 CE, however, he does not give an exact date, which
leaves an uncertainty in ayanamsha of 50". D. Senthilathiban assumes,
following an old Indian tradition, that Krishnamurti must have had in mind the
date of the equinox. Based on this assumption, the Swiss Ephemeris offers an
ayanamsha defined as follows:

Krishnamurti/Senthilathiban ayanamsha (derived from zero ayanamsha year 291)
============================================================================

:Sweph n°: ``SIDM_KRISHNAMURTI_VP291`` (45)
:Ayanamsha: 0
:t0: March 21st 291 CE, 6:10:29 TT (=4:02:45 UT)
:Note: Spica at 180° 5'13

The exact timing was derived using the Swiss Ephemeris and based on the
precession theory Vondrák 2011. Senthilathiban gives a slightly different time,
4:09 UT. This difference corresponds to less than 1 milliarcsec in precession
and can be neglected. On the other hand, since Senthilathiban prefers to use
the IAU standard model IAU 2006, whereas the Swiss Ephemeris uses precession
Vondrák, his ayanamsha calculation for the year 2000 differs by about 0.2
arcsec from ours. This difference should be considered negligible, too. Modern
calculation of precession will improve in the future, and this will lead to
small changes in this ayanamsha, as well. The Vondrák model is particularly
good for remote epochs.

In addition to the statement that zero ayanamsha year was 291, Krishnamurti
also provides a table of ayanamsha values for the years 1840 to 2001 (Reader
1, p. 58). Unfortunately, the above ayanamsha definition based on the equinox
of 291 CE does not agree well with this table. It provides values which are
about 1 arcmin too high. Since Krishnamurti wrote in a time when the precession
model of Newcomb was used, the comparison must of course be done using this
precesion model.

A better representation of the table values is given by our other Krishnamurti
ayanamsha:

Krishnamurti ayanamsha (derived from his ayanamsha table)
=========================================================

:Sweph n°: ``SIDM_KRISHNAMURTI`` (5)
:Ayanamsha: 22.363889
:t0: Jan 1st 1900
:Note: Spica at 180° 4'52

This ayanamsha was provided by Graham Dawson (astrology program "Solar Fire"),
who had taken it over from Robert Hand's program "Nova". We do not know who
developed it and using what method. Assuming that the table values refer to 1
January of each year, the agreement is very good, with only a few exceptions.
However, it must also be stated that Krishnamurti's table is not plausible for
all years. This is obvious for the years 1918-1921 where identical values are
repeated in a way that is not possible with a precession rate of about 50" per
year.

The ayanamsha based on the year 291 (No. 45), if calculated using Newcomb
precession, is about 54" arcsec higher than the one based on Krishnamurti's
tables (No. 5). (With a modern precession it is even 72-73" higher).

Senthilathiban in his book, p. 126ff., proposes a different representation of
the Krishnamurti table values, assuming that they are referred to the 13/14
April of each year, i.e. the date of the ingress of the Sun into sidereal
Aries. While this assumption is possible, we cannot be certain about it since
Krishnamurti himself does not tell us. In addition, the agreement of the two
ayanamshas (Krishnamurti table ayanamsha and Krishnamurti/Senthilathiban)
becomes even worse, not better.
