========================
The Hipparchan tradition
========================

Raymond Mercier has shown that all of the ancient Greek and the medieval Arabic
astronomical works located the zero point of the ecliptic somewhere between 10
and 22 arc minutes east of the star zeta Piscium. He is of the opinion that
this definition goes back to the great Greek astronomer Hipparchus.

Mercier points out that according to Hipparchus' star catalogue, the stars
alpha Arietis, beta Arietis, zeta Piscium, and Spica are in a very precise
alignment on a great circle which goes through that zero point near zeta
Piscium. Moreover, this great circle was identical with the horizon once a day
at Hipparchus' geographical latitude of 36°. In other words, the zero point
rose at the same time when the three mentioned stars in Aries and Pisces rose
and when Spica set.

This would of course be a nice definition for the zero point, but unfortunately
the stars were not really in such precise alignment. They were only assumed to
be so.

Hipparchus ayanamsha
====================

Mercier gives the following ayanamshas for Hipparchus and Ptolemy (who used the
same star catalogue as Hipparchus):

:Sweph n°: ``SIDM_HIPPARCHOS`` (15)
:Ayanamsha: -9°20'
:t0: June 27th –128 (jd 1674484)
:Note: zePsc 29°Pis33'49" Hipparchus

(According to Mercier's calculations, the Hipparchan zero point should have
been between 12 and 22 arc min east of zePsc, but the Hipparchan ayanamsha, as
given by Mercier, has actually the zero point 26' east of zePsc. This comes
from the fact that Mercier refers to the Hipparchan position of zeta Piscium,
which was at least rounded to 10', if correct at all.)

Using the information that Aries rose when Spica set at a geographical latitude
of 36 degrees, the precise ayanamsha would be -8°58'13" for 27 June –128 (jd
1674484) and zePsc would be found at 29°Pis12', which is too far from the place
where it ought to be.

Mercier also discusses the old Indian precession models and zodiac point
definitions. He notes that, in the Sûryasiddhânta, the star zeta Piscium (in
Sanskrit Revatî) has almost the same position as in the Greek sidereal zodiac,
i.e. 29°50' in Pisces. On the other hand, however, Spica (in Sanskrit Citrâ)
is given the longitude 30° Virgo. Unfortunately, these positions of Revatî and
Citrâ/Spica are incompatible; either Spica or Revatî must be considered wrong.

Moreover, if the precession model of the Sûryasiddânta is used to compute an
ayanamsha for the date of Hipparchus, it will turn out to be –9°14'01", which
is very close to the Hipparchan value. The same calculation can be done with
the Âryasiddânta, and the ayanamsha for Hipparchos' date will be –9°14'55". For
the Siddânta Shiromani the zero point turns out to be Revatî itself. By the
way, this is also the zero point chosen by Copernicus! So, there is an
astonishing agreement between Indian and Western traditions!

Usha-Shashi ayanamsha
=====================

The same zero point near the star Revatî is also used by the so-called
Ushâ-Shashî ayanamsha. It differs from the Hipparchan one by only 11 arc
minutes.

:Sweph n°: ``SIDM_USHASHASHI`` (4)
:Ayanamsha: 18°39'39.46
:t0: Jan. 1st 1900
:Note: zePsc (Revatî) 29°Pis50' (today), 29°Pis45' (Hipparchus' epoch)

The Greek-Arabic-Hindu ayanamsha was zero around 560 CE. The tropical and the
sidereal zero points were at exactly the same place.

In the year 556, under the Sassanian ruler Khusrau Anûshirwân, the astronomers
of Persia met to correct their astronomical tables, the so-called Zîj al-Shâh.
These tables are no longer existant, but they were the basis of later Arabic
tables, the ones of al-Khwârizmî and the Toledan tables.

One of the most important cycles in Persian astronomy/astrology was the synodic
cycle of Jupiter, which started and ended with the conjunctions of Jupiter with
the Sun. This cycle happened to end in the year 564, and the conjunction of
Jupiter with the Sun took place only one day after the spring equinox. And the
spring equinox took place precisely 10 arcmin east of zePsc. This may be a mere
coincidence from a present-day astronomical point of view, but for scientists
of those days this was obviously the moment to redefine all astronomical data.

Mercier also shows that in the precession (trepidation) model used in that time
and in other models used later by Arabic astronomers, precession was considered
to be a phenomenon connected with "the movement of Jupiter, the calendar marker
of the night sky, in its relation to the Sun, the time keeper of the daily sky".
Such theories were of course wrong, from the point of view of modern knowledge,
but they show how important that date was considered to be.

Sassanian ayanamsha
===================

After the Sassanian reform of astronomical tables, we have a new definition of
the Greek-Arabic-Hindu sidereal zodiac (this is not explicitly stated by
Mercier, however):

:Sweph n°: ``SIDM_SASSANIAN`` (16)
:Ayanamsha: 0
:t0: March 18th 564, 7:53:23 UT (jd/ET 1927135.8747793)
:Note: Sassanian zePsc 29°Pis49'59"

The same zero point then reappears with a precision of 1' in the Toledan
tables, the Khwârizmian tables, the Sûrya Siddhânta, and the Ushâ-Shashî
ayanamsha.
