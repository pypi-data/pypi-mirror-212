===================
Hypothetical bodies
===================

We include some astrological factors in the ephemeris which have no
astronomical basis â€“ they have never been observed physically. As the purpose
of the Swiss Ephemeris is astrology, we decided to drop our scientific view in
this area and to be of service to those astrologers who use these
'hypothetical' planets and factors. Of course neither of our scientific
sources, JPL or Steve Moshier, have anything to do with this part of the Swiss
Ephemeris.
