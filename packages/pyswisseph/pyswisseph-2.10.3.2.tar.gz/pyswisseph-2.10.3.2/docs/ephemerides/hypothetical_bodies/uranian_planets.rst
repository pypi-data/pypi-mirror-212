Uranian planets (Hamburg planets: Cupido, Hades, Zeus, Kronos, Apollon, Admetos, Vulkanus, Poseidon)

There have been discussions whether these factors are to be called 'planets' or
'Transneptunian points'. However, their inventors, the German astrologers Witte
and Sieggrün, considered them to be planets. And moreover they behave like
planets in as far as they circle around the Sun and obey its gravity.

On the other hand, if one looks at their orbital elements, it is obvious that
these orbits are highly unrealistic. Some of them are perfect circles –-
something that does not exist in physical reality. The inclination of the
orbits is zero, which is very improbable as well. The revised elements
published by James Neely in Matrix Journal VII (1980) show small eccentricities
for the four Witte planets, but they are still smaller than the eccentricity of
Venus which has an almost circular orbit. This is again very improbable.

There are even more problems. An ephemeris computed with such elements
describes an unperturbed motion, i.e. it takes into account only the Sun's
gravity, not the gravitational influences of the other planets. This may result
in an error of a degree within the 20th century, and greater errors for earlier
centuries.

Also, note that none of the real transneptunian objects that have been
discovered since 1992 can be identified with any of the Uranian planets.

SwissEph uses James Neely's revised orbital elements, because they agree better
with the original position tables of Witte and Sieggrün.

The hypothetical planets can again be called with any of the three ephemeris
flags. The solar position needed for geocentric positions will then be taken
from the ephemeris specified.
