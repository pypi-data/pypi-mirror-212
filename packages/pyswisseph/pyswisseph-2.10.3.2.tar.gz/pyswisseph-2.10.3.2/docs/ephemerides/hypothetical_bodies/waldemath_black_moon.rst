==========================
Dr. Waldemath's Black Moon
==========================

This is another hypothetical second Moon of the Earth, postulated by a Dr.
Waldemath in the Monthly Wheather Review 1/1898. Its distance from the Earth is
2.67 times the distance of the Moon, its daily motion about 3 degrees. The
orbital elements have been derived from Waldemath's original data. There are
significant differences from elements used in earlier versions of Solar Fire,
due to different interpretations of the values given by Waldemath. After a
discussion between Graham Dawson and Dieter Koch it has been agreed that the
new solution is more likely to be correct. The new ephemeris does not agree
with Delphine Jay's ephemeris either, which is obviously inconsistent with
Waldemath's data.

This body has never been confirmed. With its 700-km diameter and an apparent
diameter of 2.5 arc min, this should have been possible very soon after
Waldemath's publication.
