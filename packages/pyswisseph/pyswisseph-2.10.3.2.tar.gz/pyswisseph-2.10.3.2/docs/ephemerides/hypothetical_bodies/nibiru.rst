Nibiru
======

A highly speculative planet derived from the theory of Zecharia Sitchin, who is
an expert in ancient Mesopotamian history and a "paleoastronomer". The elements
have been supplied by Christian Woeltge, Hannover. This planet is interesting
because of its bizarre orbit. It moves in clockwise direction and has a period
of 3600 years. Its orbit is extremely eccentric. It has its perihelion within
the asteroid belt, whereas its aphelion lies at about 12 times the mean
distance of Pluto. In spite of its retrograde motion, it seems to move
counterclockwise in recent centuries. The reason is that it is so slow that it
does not even compensate the precession of the equinoxes.
