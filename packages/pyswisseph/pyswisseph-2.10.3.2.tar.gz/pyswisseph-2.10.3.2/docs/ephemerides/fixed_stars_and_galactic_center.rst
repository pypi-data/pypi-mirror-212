Fixed stars and Galactic Center
===============================

A database of fixed stars is included with Swiss Ephemeris. It contains about
800 stars, which can be computed with the ``swe_fixstar()`` function. The
precision is about 0.001".

This database was originally based on the star catalogue of Steve Moshier. It
was improved in 1999 by Valentin Abramov, Tartu, Estonia. He reordered the
stars by constellation, added some stars, many names and alternative spellings
of names.

In Feb. 2006 (Version 1.70) the fixed stars file was updated with data from the
SIMBAD database. (http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/Simbad)

In Jan. 2011 (Version 1.77) a new fixed stars file ``sefstars.txt`` was created
from the SIMBAD database with a data format that is compatible with the SIMBAD
database. The file continues to be updated every few years.

(The latest version of ``sefstars.txt`` is found at astro.com download area:

:doc:`/programmers_manual/fixed_stars/fixed_stars_positions`.)
