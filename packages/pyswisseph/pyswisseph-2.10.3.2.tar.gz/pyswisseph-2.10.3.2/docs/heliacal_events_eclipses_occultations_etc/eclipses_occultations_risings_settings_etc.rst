Eclipses, occultations, risings, settings, and other planetary phenomena
========================================================================

The Swiss Ephemeris also includes functions for many calculations concerning
solar and lunar eclipses. You can:

- search for eclipses or occultations, globally or for a given geographical
  position;
- compute global or local circumstances of eclipses or occultations;
- compute the geographical position where an eclipse is central.

Moreover, you can compute for all planets and asteroids:

- risings and settings (also for stars);
- midheaven and lower heaven transits (also for stars);
- height of a body above the horizon (refracted and true, also for stars);
- phase angle;
- phase (illumined fraction of disc);
- elongation (angular distance between a planet and the Sun);
- apparent diameter of a planetary disc;
- apparent magnitude.
