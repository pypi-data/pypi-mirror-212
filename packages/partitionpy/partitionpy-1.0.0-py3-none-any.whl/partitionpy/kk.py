    State of the art approximation algorithm. Also known as largest differencing method (LDM).

    Runtime complexity in O(nlogn).
    Yields discrepancy in O(1/n^(0.72)) on average.

    (Korf is very readable.)

    :param: numbers is a list of integers.
    :param: return_indices can be set to true when the algorithm shall return the indices to build
            the partition instead of the partition itself

    Implementation notes:
    This implementation is not as fast and probably more memory consuming than the implementation
    from the numberpartitioning package (https://pypi.org/project/numberpartitioning/).
    Trading the quite readable implementation with a _Node class and using networkx against a more
    optimized version is advised.
