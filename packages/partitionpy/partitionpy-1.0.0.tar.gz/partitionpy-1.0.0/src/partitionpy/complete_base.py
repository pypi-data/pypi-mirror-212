    Base for complete algorithms. Takes a heuristic algorithm as a start.

    Stops when a perfect partition is found.
    If the current discrepancy is larger than the sum of remaining numbers, the only option is to
    put all of them in the smaller list.

    Open tasks:
    * implement Limited Discrepancy Search
    * make it a true anytime algorithm; implement possibility to stop manually before the algorithm
      has finished
    * the function is quite complex and pylint is not happy. Break it down better.
