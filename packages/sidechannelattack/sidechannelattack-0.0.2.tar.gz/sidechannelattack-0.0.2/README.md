Alignment principle: the reference curve l_0 is selected and the rest of the curve l_i is aligned towards l_0, using the pattern matching method.
Dimensionality reduction principle: PCA dimensionality reduction
Filtering principle: open source package signal: low-pass, band-pass, high-pass. Own implementation of fast filtering.
nb.jit is different from nb.cuda.jit and should be distinguished
When the amount of data is large, it should be stored in blocks and the corresponding side channel processing method should consider how to process it block by block.
