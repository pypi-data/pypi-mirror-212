    The contract needed to expose the [AmoraModel](amora-model) definition as a [Feature View](feature-view.md)

    To expose an `AmoraModel` as a Feature View, one must decorate it with
    `amora.feature_store.decorators.feature_view` and implement the
    `FeatureViewProcotol` class methods.

    !!! hint

        Returns a list of the model columns that should be used as an [entity](feature-view.md#entities). E.g:

        An `AmoraModel` with a single `customer_id` entity:

        ```python
        @classmethod
        def feature_view_entities(cls) -> List[Column]:
            return [cls.customer_id]
        ```

        An `AmoraModel` with multiple entities, `customer_id` and `company_id`:

        ```python
        @classmethod
        def feature_view_entities(cls) -> List[Column]:
            return [cls.customer_id, cls.company_id]
        ```

        A model with no entities:

        ```python
        @classmethod
        def feature_view_entities(cls) -> List[Column]:
            return []
        ```
        """

    def feature_view_features(cls) -> List[Column]:
        """
        Returns a list of the model columns that should be used as [features](feature-view.md#features). E.g:

        Features of a customer entity could be _the number of transactions
        they have made on a month_ as `count_transactions_last_30d` and _the sum
        of the transactions amounts they have made on a month_
        as `sum_transactions_last_30d`:
