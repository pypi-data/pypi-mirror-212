Lensing
=======

When two galaxies are aligned perfectly down the line-of-sight to Earth, the background galaxy's light is bent by the
intervening mass of the foreground galaxy. Its light can be fully bent around the foreground galaxy, traversing multiple
paths to the Earth, meaning that the background galaxy is observed multiple times. This by-chance alignment of two
galaxies is called a strong gravitational lens and a two-dimensional scheme of such a system is pictured below.

**PyAutoLens** is software for analysing strong lenses!

To use **PyAutoLens** we first import autolens and the plot module.

.. code-block:: python

   import autolens as al
   import autolens.plot as aplt

Grids
-----

To describe the deflection of light due to the lens galaxy's mass, **PyAutoLens** uses ``Grid2D`` data structures, which
are two-dimensional Cartesian grids of (y,x) coordinates.

Below, we create and plot a uniform Cartesian ``Grid2D`` (the ``pixel_scales`` describes the conversion from pixel
units to arc-seconds):

.. code-block:: python

    grid = al.Grid2D.uniform(
        shape_native=(50, 50), pixel_scales=0.05
    )
    grid_plotter = aplt.Grid2DPlotter(grid=grid)
    grid_plotter.figure_2d()

This is what our ``Grid2D`` looks like:

Light Profiles
--------------

We will ray-trace this ``Grid2D``'s (y,x) coordinates to calculate how a lens galaxy's mass deflects the source
galaxy's light.

This requires analytic functions representing the light and mass distributions of galaxies. **PyAutoLens**
uses ``Profile`` objects for this, such as the elliptical sersic ``LightProfile``:

.. code-block:: python

    sersic_light_profile = al.lp.Sersic(
        centre=(0.0, 0.0),
        ell_comps=(0.1, 0.1),
        intensity=0.05,
        effective_radius=2.0,
        sersic_index=4.0,
    )

By passing this ``Profile`` a ``Grid2D``, we can evaluate the light at every coordinate on that ``Grid2D``, creating an
image of the ``LightProfile``:

.. code-block:: python

    image = sersic_light_profile.image_2d_from(grid=grid)

The **PyAutoLens** plot module provides methods for plotting objects and their properties, like the ``LightProfile``'s image.

.. code-block:: python

    light_profile_plotter = aplt.LightProfilePlotter(
        light_profile=sersic_light_profile, grid=grid
    )
    light_profile_plotter.figures_2d(image=True)

The light profile's image appears as shown below:

Mass Profiles
-------------

**PyAutoLens** uses ``MassProfile`` objects to represent a galaxy's mass distribution and perform ray-tracing
calculations.

Below we create an elliptical isothermal ``MassProfile`` and calculate and display its convergence, gravitational
potential and deflection angles using the Cartesian grid:

.. code-block:: python

    isothermal_mass_profile = al.mp.Isothermal(
        centre=(0.0, 0.0),
        ell_comps=(0.1, 0.1),
        einstein_radius=1.6,
    )

    convergence = isothermal_mass_profile.convergence_2d_from(grid=grid)
    potential = isothermal_mass_profile.potential_2d_from(grid=grid)
    deflections = isothermal_mass_profile.deflections_yx_2d_from(grid=grid)

    mass_profile_plotter = aplt.MassProfilePlotter(
        mass_profile=isothermal_mass_profile, grid=grid
    )
    mass_profile_plotter.figures_2d(
        convergence=True, potential=True, deflections_y=True, deflections_x=True
    )

Here is how the convergence, potential and deflection angles appear:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoLens/main/docs/overview/images/lensing/isothermal_mass_profile_convergence.png

  :width: 400
  :alt: Alternative text

For anyone not familiar with gravitational lensing, don't worry about what the convergence and potential are for now.
The key thing to note is that the deflection angles describe how a given mass distribution deflects light-rays as they
travel towards the Earth through the Universe.

Galaxies
--------

A ``Galaxy`` object is a collection of ``LightProfile`` and ``MassProfile`` objects at a given redshift. The code below
creates two galaxies representing the lens and source galaxies shown in the strong lensing diagram above.

.. code-block:: python

   lens_galaxy = al.Galaxy(
       redshift=0.5, light=sersic_light_profile, mass=isothermal_mass_profile
   )

   source_galaxy = al.Galaxy(redshift=1.0, light=another_light_profile)

The geometry of the strong lens system depends on the cosmological distances between the Earth, the lens galaxy and
the source galaxy. It there depends on the redshifts of the ``Galaxy`` objects.

By passing these ``Galaxy`` objects to a ``Tracer``, **PyAutoLens** uses these galaxy redshifts and a cosmological
model to create the appropriate strong lens system.

.. code-block:: python

    tracer = al.Tracer.from_galaxies(
        galaxies=[lens_galaxy, source_galaxy], cosmology=al.cosmo.Planck15()
    )

Ray Tracing
-----------

We can now create the image of a strong lens system!

When calculating this image, the ``Tracer`` performs all ray-tracing for the strong lens system. This includes using
the lens galaxy's total mass distribution to deflect the light-rays that are traced to the source galaxy. As a result,
the source appears as a multiply imaged and strongly lensed Einstein ring.

.. code-block:: python

    image = tracer.image_2d_from(grid=grid)

    tracer_plotter = aplt.TracerPlotter(tracer=tracer, grid=grid)
    tracer_plotter.figures_2d(image=True)

This makes the image below, where the source's light appears as a multiply imaged and strongly lensed Einstein ring.

Extending Objects
-----------------

The **PyAutoLens** API has been designed such that all of the objects introduced above are extensible. ``Galaxy``
objects can take many ``Profile``'s and ``Tracer`` objects many ``Galaxy``'s.

If the galaxies are at different redshifts a strong lensing system with multiple lens planes will be created,
performing complex multi-plane ray-tracing calculations.

To finish, lets create a ``Tracer`` with 3 galaxies at 3 different redshifts, forming a system with two distinct
Einstein rings! The mass distribution of the first galaxy also has separate components for its stellar mass and
dark matter, where the stellar mass using a ``LightMassProfile`` representing both its light and mass.

.. code-block:: python

    lens_galaxy_0 = al.Galaxy(
        redshift=0.5,
        bulge=al.lmp.Sersic(
            centre=(0.0, 0.0),
            ell_comps=(0.0, 0.05),
            intensity=0.5,
            effective_radius=0.3,
            sersic_index=2.5,
            mass_to_light_ratio=0.3,
        ),
        disk=al.lmp.Exponential(
            centre=(0.0, 0.0),
            ell_comps=(0.0, 0.1),
            intensity=1.0,
            effective_radius=2.0,
            mass_to_light_ratio=0.2,
        ),
        dark=al.mp.NFWSph(centre=(0.0, 0.0), kappa_s=0.08, scale_radius=30.0),
    )

    lens_galaxy_1 = al.Galaxy(
        redshift=1.0,
        light=al.lp.Exponential(
            centre=(0.1, 0.1), , ell_comps=(0.1, 0.1), intensity=3.0, effective_radius=0.1
        ),
        mass=al.mp.Isothermal(
            centre=(0.1, 0.1), , ell_comps=(0.1, 0.1), einstein_radius=0.4
        ),
    )

    source_galaxy = al.Galaxy(
        redshift=2.0,
        light=al.lp.Sersic(
            centre=(0.2, 0.2),
            ell_comps=(0.05, -0.1),
            intensity=2.0,
            effective_radius=0.1,
            sersic_index=1.5,
        ),
    )

    tracer = al.Tracer.from_galaxies(galaxies=[lens_galaxy_0, lens_galaxy_1, source_galaxy])

    tracer_plotter = aplt.TracerPlotter(tracer=tracer, grid=grid)
    tracer_plotter.figures_2d(image=True)

This is what the lens looks like:
