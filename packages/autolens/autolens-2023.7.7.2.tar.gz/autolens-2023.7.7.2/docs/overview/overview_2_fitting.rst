Fitting Data
============

A ``Tracer`` object represents a strong lens system and allows us to create images of the lens galaxy and lensed source
galaxy.

Loading Data
------------

We are now going to use a ``Tracer`` to fit imaging data of a strong lens, which we begin by loading
from .fits files as an ``Imaging`` object:

.. code-block:: python

    dataset_path = "/path/to/dataset/folder"

    dataset = al.Imaging.from_fits(
        data_path=path.join(dataset_path, "data.fits"),
        psf_path=path.join(dataset_path, "psf.fits"),
        noise_map_path=path.join(dataset_path, "noise_map.fits"),
        pixel_scales=0.1,
    )

    dataset_plotter = aplt.ImagingPlotter(dataset=dataset)
    dataset_plotter.figures_2d(image=True, noise_map=True, psf=True)

Here's what our ``image``, ``noise_map`` and ``psf`` (point-spread function) look like:

Masking
-------

We now need to mask the data, so that regions where there is no signal (e.g. the edges) are omitted from the fit. To do
this we can use a ``Mask2D`` object, which for this example we'll create as a 3.0" circle.

.. code-block:: python

    mask = al.Mask2D.circular(
        shape_native=dataset.shape_native, pixel_scales=dataset.pixel_scales, sub_size=1, radius=3.0
    )

    dataset = dataset.apply_mask(mask=mask_2d)

    dataset_plotter = aplt.ImagingPlotter(dataset=dataset)
    dataset_plotter.figures_2d(image=True)

Here is what our image looks like with the mask applied, where **PyAutoLens** has automatically zoomed around the
``Mask2D`` to make the lensed source appear bigger:

Fitting
-------

Following the lensing API guide, we can make a ``Tracer`` from a collection of ``LightProfile``, ``MassProfile`` and
``Galaxy`` objects. This ``Tracer`` then allows us to create an image of the strong lens system.

By passing a ``Tracer`` and ``Imaging`` object to a ``FitImaging`` object, we create a model-image from the ``Tracer``.
The model-image is the image of the ``Tracer`` blurred with the ``Imaging`` dataset's PSF, ensuring our fit to the data
provides a like-with-like comparison.

.. code-block:: python

    fit = al.FitImaging(dataset=masked_dataset, tracer=tracer)

    fit_plotter = aplt.FitImagingPlotter(fit=fit)
    fit_plotter.figures_2d(model_image=True)

Here is how the ``Tracer``'s image and the ``FitImaging``'s model-image look, note how the model-image has been blurred
with the PSF of our dataset:

  :width: 400

The ``FitImaging`` object does a lot more than just create the model-image, it also subtracts this image from
the data to produce a residual-map and combines this with the noise-map to compute a chi-squared-map, both of which
we can plot:

.. code-block:: python

    fit_plotter = aplt.FitImagingPlotter(fit=fit)

    fit_plotter.figures_2d(
        residual_map=True,
        chi_squared_map=True
    )

For a good lens model where the ``Tracer``'s model image is representative of the strong lens system the residuals and
chi-squared values minimized:

  :width: 400

Most importantly, the ``FitImaging`` object also provides us with a *log likelihood*, a single value measure of how good
our ``Tracer`` fitted the dataset:

.. code-block:: python

    print(fit.log_likelihood)

Bad Fit
-------

In contrast, a bad lens model will show features in the residual-map and chi-squareds:

If we can find a ``Tracer`` that produces a high log likelihood, we'll have a model
which is representative of our strong lens data! This task, called lens modeling, is covered in the next API overview.

Wrap Up

If you are unfamilar with data and model fitting, and unsure what terms like 'residuals', 'chi-sqaured' or '
likelihood' mean, we'll explain all in chapter 1 of the **HowToLens** lecture series. Checkout the
