name: Setup Conda and install parcels
description: >
  In-repo composite action to setup Conda and install parcels. Installation of parcels relies on
  `setup.py` file being available in the root. For general setup of Anaconda environments, just use
  the `mamba-org/provision-with-micromamba` action (setting C variables as required), or the `conda-incubator/setup-miniconda` action.
