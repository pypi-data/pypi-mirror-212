**BuildFlow**, is an open source framework that lets you build a data pipeline by simply attaching a decorator to a Python function. All you need to do is describe where your input is coming from and where your output should be written, and BuildFlow handles the rest. No configuration outside of the code is required.

Key Features:

- Unified **batch** and **streaming** [Processor API](https://www.buildflow.dev/docs/processors/overview)
- Production-grade [IO connectors](https://www.buildflow.dev/docs/io-connectors/overview) for popular cloud services & storage systems
- IO templates for common data pipelines (e.g. [file upload notifications](https://www.buildflow.dev/docs/io-connectors/gcs_notifications))
- Automatic [resource creation / management](https://www.buildflow.dev/docs/resource-creation) for popular cloud resources
- [Schema validation](https://www.buildflow.dev/docs/schema-validation) powered by Python dataclasses and type hints
- Automatic parallelism powered by [Ray](https://ray.io)

## Quickstart

### Install

```bash
pip install buildflow
```

### Example Usage

```python
# Import the buildflow package
import buildflow
from buildflow import Flow

# Create the Flow object
flow = Flow()

# Define your input / output
@flow.processor(
   source=buildflow.PubSubSource(subscription='my_subscription'),
   sink=buildflow.BigQuerySink(table_id='project.dataset.table'),
)
def stream_processor(pubsub_message):
  # TODO(developer): Implement processing logic
  ...
  # The output is sent to the sink provider
  return pubsub_message

# Start the processor(s)
flow.run().output()
```

## Windows Users

Our runtime is built on [Ray](https://ray.io/), where Windows support is currently in beta. See the [Ray docs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/installation.html#windows-support) for more info.

## Code Health Checks

We use [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to perform health checks.
To setup these locally:

- Clone the repo
- Install the `dev` dependencies like `python -m pip install .[dev]
- Check if pre-commit is installed correctly by running `pre-commit --version`
- Setup pre-commit to run before every commit on staged changes by running `pre-commit install`
- Pre-commit can also be ran manually as `pre-commit run --all-files`
