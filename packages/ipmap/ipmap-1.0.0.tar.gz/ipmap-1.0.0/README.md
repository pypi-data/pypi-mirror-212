ipmap is an easy-to-use ip geolocation and mapping tool written in Python

IPMap geolocates a given ip address/addresses from a file, then generates a [leaflet](https://github.com/leaflet/leaflet) map pin-pointing the location of each ip address on it (with the right argument).

# Features
- [x] Looks up ip address(es) and returns the associated information.
- [x] Looks up an ip address(es) and returns the associated information then pin points the location of the ip address(es) on a generated leaflet.
- [x] Opens Google Earth on the specified coordinates (format: latitude longitude).
- [x] Generated maps are saved to the `maps` directory which is created on runtime if it does not exist.
- [x] Does not use external dependencies for the map, instead uses an already written html ![map template](ipmap/data/templates/map.html).

# Installation
## PyPI
IPMap can be installed from PyPI by running the folloing command in terminal/command prompt
```
pip install ipmap
```
## GitHub
Or if you prefer to install it from source, you can run the following command
```
pip install git+https://github.com/rly0nheart/ipmap.git
```
## Build from source
```Python
# install poetry
pip install poetry

# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/rly0nheart/ipmap

# move to the ipmap directory
cd ipmap

# build the wheel file
poetry build

# install the built wheel (Linux)
pip install dist/*.whl

# install built wheel (Windows)
pip install .\dist\generated-wheel-file-name.whl
```

# Usage
To see the usage, you can simply run
```
ipmap --help
```
The output should look like the following
```
usage: 
    Geolocate IP Address(es) (with an interactive map)
    --------------------------------------------------
    ipmap map --ip <ip/file_containing_ip_addresses>

    Open Google Earth on the given coordinates
    --------------------------------------------
    ipmap earth --coordinates <latitude> <longitude>

    Lookup IP Address(es) (same as map but without an interactive map)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    ipmap lookup --ip <ip/file_containing_ip_addresses>

modes:
    map - creates an interactive map and pin points the locations of the specified ip address(es) on it.
    earth - opens google earth on the specified coordinates
    lookup - looks up the specified ip address(es)' information.
