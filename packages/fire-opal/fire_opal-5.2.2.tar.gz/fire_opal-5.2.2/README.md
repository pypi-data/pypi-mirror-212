# Fire Opal Client

The Fire Opal Client package is a Python client for Q-CTRL's Fire Opal product.
Fire Opal is a simple and powerful package for algorithm developers and quantum computer end users.
By applying a complete suite of error suppression techniques, Fire Opal automatically reduces error and vastly improves the quality of quantum algorithm results. This often transforms quantum computer outputs from random to useful.
