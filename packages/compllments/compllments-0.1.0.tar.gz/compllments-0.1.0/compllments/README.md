## Description

This package enables you to send scheduled, uplifting, AI-generated text messages to your friends. 

It works by first using an LLM to generate a batch of positive and complimentary messages in the language of your choice. Then, a multilingual sentiment classifier scores all the generated posts and selects the most positive to send either as an SMS or over WhatsApp. [Here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gfTlCWNFgpHdvLR5g8o-OV_a30Pfps60?usp=sharing) is the accompanying Colab notebook.


DISCLAIMER: If someone you know is suffering from mental health difficulties, please reach out person-to-person or encourage them to seek professional *human* help instead of from chatbots. [Here](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/find-help) is one good resource of many.

## Installation

First, ensure that [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) is installed. 

```
poetry install
poe install-pytorch
```

To download files to store locally and save time of future downloads, run:

```
download -m path/on/huggingface
```

To send SMS messages, first create a free [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us) account and create a phone number (note: Twilio automatically prepends the message `Sent from your Twilio trial account` to free-tier accounts). Copy your credentials from the dashboard into the `TWILIO_CONFIG` dictionary in `config.py`. An example config will look like:

```
 {
    "account_sid": "a_string",
    "auth_token": "a_token",
    "from_": "+11234567890",
}
```
To send WhatsApp messages, you must log in from your computer.

## Usage

Texts are sent by running:

```
send -r recipient-name -s sender-name -n +11234567890 -l language -b -t type
```

`send --help` explains the parameter options. Pass your OpenAI API key using `-o` to use their models.

You can send custom messages by chaning the text in the `TEMPLATE` object in `main.py`

You can set custom model configuration in the `INFERENCE_CONFIG` object in `conifg.py` including swapping out models, increasing the output length by chaning `max_new_tokens` or increasing the randomness in reponses by raising `temperature` or `top_p`. The default language generation model is `mosaicml/mpt-7b-instruct` which is the [best performing open-sourced LLM](https://gpt4all.io/index.html) at the time of creation. The default sentiment analysis model is `cardiffnlp/xlm-roberta-base-sentiment-multilingual` which supports 8 languagees: `arabic`, `english`, `french`, `german`, `hindi`, `italian`, `portuguese`, and, `spanish`. 


To schedule texts to be sent at regular intervals, create a crontab similar to the example in `cron`.
