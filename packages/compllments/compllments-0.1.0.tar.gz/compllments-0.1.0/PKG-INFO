## Description

This package enables you to send scheduled, uplifting, AI-generated text messages to yourself and your friends. 

It works by first using am LLM to generate a batch of positive and complimentary messages in the language of choice. Then, a multilingual sentiment classifier scores all the generated posts and selects the most positive to send either as an SMS or over WhatsApp.


DISCLAIMER: If you or someone you know is suffering from mental health difficulties, please seek professional *human* help instead of from chatbots. 
[Here]() is one good resource of many.


Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

First, ensure that [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) is installed. 

```
poetry install
poe install-pytorch
```

To download files to store locally and save time of future downloads, run:
`download -m path/on/huggingface`

To send SMS messages, first create a free [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us) account (note: Twilio automatically prepends the message `blah` to free-tier accounts). Copy your credentials from the dashboard into the `TWILIO_CONFIG` dictionary in `config.py`. An example config will look like:
```
 {
    "account_sid": "a_string",
    "auth_token": "a_token",
}
```

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

Texts are sent by running:
```
send -r recipient-name -s sender-name -n +11234567890 -l language -b -t sms
```

`send --help` explains the parameter options.

You can send custom messages by chaning the text in the `TEMPLATE` object in `main.py`

You can set custom model configuration in the `INFERENCE_CONFIG` object in `conifg.py` including swapping out models, increasing the output length by chaning `max_new_tokens` or increasing the randomness in reponses by raising `temperature` or `top_p`.


Below are some example text generations
```
```

And here are the sentiment scores for them

To schedule texts to be sent at regular intervals, 
- crontab setup
