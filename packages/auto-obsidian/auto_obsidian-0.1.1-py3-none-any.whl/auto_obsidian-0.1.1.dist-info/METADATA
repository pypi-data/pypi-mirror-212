# Metalayer

When you install this package, you will get a command line tool called `metalayer`.

## Prerequisites

### Setting up your knowledge repo
To start recording your screen and saving auto-generated markdown notes to a folder, 
you need to first create the folder. I call mine Knowledge Repo. 
Then, create a subfolder for each topic you want to record notes for. 
NOTE: for each subfolder, you need to create a file called `_desciption.md`,
which should have a 1-3 sentence description of what you want to be indexed into that folder. 
A more specific description will make filtering quality better. Here's an example from my repo:
```
Knowledge Repo
├── Control Theory
│   ├── _description.md
│   └── Model Predictive Control
│       └── _description.md
└── Evolutionary Algorithms
    └── _description.md
```
*Evolutionary Algorithms/_description.md:*
```
Everything related to evolultionary algorithms an genetic algorithms, including motiviation, 
parallels to biological evolution, computational properties, implementation, variants, applications, etc.
```

### Permissions
Go to System Preferences > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording and check the box next to Terminal. 
If Terminal is not in the list, idk google how to add it there.

If you're using chrome, you also need to enable apple events since metalayer uses those to get the 
title of the active tab and other metadata. 
To do this, open chrome, go to View > Developer > Allow JavaScript from Apple Events.

## Running the metalayer

When you've done all of the above instructions, run the following command:

```bash
metalayer -v /path/to/Knowledge\ Repo
```

This will start recording your screen(s) and printing a bunch of stuff.
Once you start looking at stuff related to the folders you created, files should start appearing in those folders.
Open up your Knowledge Repo folder up in Obsidian to explore the notes!
