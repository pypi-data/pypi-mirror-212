Coreferences are situations where two or more words within a text refer to the same entity, e.g. _**John** went home because **he** was tired_. Resolving coreferences is an important general task within the natural language processing field.

Coreferee is a Python 3 library (tested with versions 3.6—3.11) that is used together with [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) (tested with versions 3.0.0—3.5.0) to resolve coreferences within English, French, German and Polish texts. It is designed so that it is easy to add support for new languages. It uses a mixture of neural networks and programmed rules.

The library was originally developed at [msg systems](https://www.msg.group/en) and was also maintained for a while at [Explosion AI](https://explosion.ai).
