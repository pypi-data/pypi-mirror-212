**pycreg** is a Python package for machine learing with convex regression models built on [`pyStoNED`](https://github.com/ds2010/pyStoNED). 

The core aims of this package are:
* make convex regression models "easy to call" from python,
* interface with [`pyStoNED`](https://github.com/ds2010/pyStoNED),
* focus on a "machine learning" perspective, i.e.: predictive task, hyper-parameters should be obtained by a data-driven method such as cross-validation.
