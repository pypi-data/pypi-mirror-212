Reactor Community Edition Free Software License FAQs

1. Why are you providing a free version of Diveplane Reactor?

   We are excited to announce the release of a free version of our AI software,
   Reactor(tm), which is called Reactor Community Edition. We believe that
   everyone should have access to this groundbreaking technology, and we are
   committed to keeping the humanity in AI. Our free version includes many of
   the core features of our paid version, with some limitations. We hope that
   this free version will allow more people to experience the power of AI and
   to use it to make the world a better place.

2. Is this license indefinite?

   No. This license lasts through December 31, 2023. It is our intention to
   release an open source version of Reactor Community Edition, which will
   replace this freeware version.

3. Can I use Reactor Community Edition for my personal, school, and
   commercial projects?

   You can use Reactor Community Edition in your back-end systems for personal,

   hardware or software product that contains Reactor Community Edition.

   that includes Reactor Community Edition?

   You cannot do that under the free license, but feel free to contact us for a

   Edition.
