2023
====

I am releasing a hotfix for the PyPI package, version 0.0.4. This update addresses a minor issue caused by a change in the naming scheme of GitHub repositories, which was preventing the package from building properly in all Python environments. Additionally, I would like to inform you that support for pypy37 has been discontinued.

I am currently addressing the challenges caused by the insufficient documentation and actively working on improving it.

EOL
===

The project has been flagged as EOL (End of Life) on December 2022. Moving forward to a more simplistic approach for better automation and other changes. You can still use the structure but please don't expect more updates or support.
