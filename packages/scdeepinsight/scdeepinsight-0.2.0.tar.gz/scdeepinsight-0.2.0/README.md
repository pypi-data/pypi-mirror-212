# Introduction of scDeepInsight
scDeepInsight provides pretrained cell type annotation model for scRNA-seq data. For further illustrations and vignettes, please refer to:[scDeepInsight](https://github.com/shangruJia/scDeepInsight)
Users can directly use this tool to annotate PBMC datasets without performing training by themselves. In future, we will provide more pretrained models for other types of tissues.

# Defined functions

- ImageTransform(query_path:str, barcode_path:str, image_path:str)
> **query_path**: The absoulte path of the target scRNA-seq dataset (end with .h5ad). 
> **barcode_path**: The absoulte path where you wish to store the generated barcode file (end with .csv).
> **image_path**: The absoulte path where you wish to store the generated image file (end with .npy).
> 
-  Annotate (barcode_path:str, image_path:str, batch_size:int = 128)
> **barcode_path**: The absoulte path where you have stored the generated barcode file (end with .csv).
> **image_path**: The absoulte path where you have stored the generated image file (end with .npy).
>  **batch_size**: The batch size you wish to load to the converted image dataset when using the pretrained model for annotation. Defaulted value is 128.
