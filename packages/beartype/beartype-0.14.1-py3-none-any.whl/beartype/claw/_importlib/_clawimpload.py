class BeartypeSourceFileLoader(SourceFileLoader):
    '''
    **Beartype source file loader** implementing :mod:`importlib` machinery
    loading a **sourceful Python package or module** (i.e., package or module
    backed by a ``.py``-suffixed source file) into a **module spec** (i.e.,
    in-memory :class:`importlib._bootstrap.ModuleSpec` instance describing the
    importation of that package or module, complete with a reference back to
    this originating loader).

    The :func:`beartype_package` function injects a low-level **import path
    hook** (i.e., factory closure instantiating this class as an item of the
    standard :mod:`sys.path_hooks` list) to the front of that list. When called
    by a higher-level parent **import metapath hook** (i.e., object suitable for
    use as an item of the standard :mod:`sys.meta_path` list), that closure:

    #. Instantiates one instance of the standard
       :class:`importlib._bootstrap_external.FileFinder` class for each
       **imported Python package** (i.e., package on the :mod:`sys.path` list).
       The :meth:``importlib._bootstrap_external.FileFinder.find_spec` method of
       that instance then returns this :class:`BeartypeSourceFileLoader` class
       uninstantiated for each **imported Python package submodule** (i.e.,
       submodule directly contained in that package).
    #. Adds a new key-value pair to the standard :mod:`sys.path_importer_cache`
       dictionary, whose:

       * Key is the package of that module.
       * Value is that instance of this class.

    Motivation
    ----------
    This loader was intentionally implemented so as to exclusively leverage the
    lower-level :attr:`sys.path_hooks` mechanism for declaring import hooks
    rather than both that *and* the higher-level :attr:`sys.meta_path`
    mechanism. All prior efforts in the Python ecosystem to transform the
    abstract syntax trees (ASTs) of modules at importation time via import hooks
    leverage both mechanisms. This includes:

    * :mod:`pytest`, which rewrites test assertion statements via import hooks
      leveraging both mechanisms.
    * :mod:`typeguard`, which implicitly applies the runtime type-checking
      :func:`typguard.typechecked` decorator via import hooks leveraging both
      mechanisms.
    * :mod:`ideas`, which applies arbitrary caller-defined AST transformations
      via (...wait for it) import hooks leveraging both mechanisms.

    Beartype subverts this long-storied tradition by *only* leveraging the
    lower-level :attr:`sys.path_hooks` mechanism. Doing so reduces maintenance
    burden, code complexity, and inter-package conflicts. The latter is
    particularly salient. AST transformations applied by both :mod:`typeguard`
    and :mod:`ideas` accidentally conflict with those applied by :mod:`pytest`.
    Why? Because (in order):

    #. When run as a test suite runner, :mod:`pytest` necessarily runs first and
       thus prepends its import hook as the new first item of the
       :attr:`sys.meta_path` list.
    #. When imported during subsequent unit and/or integration testing under
       that test suite runner, :mod:`typeguard` and :mod:`ideas` then install
       their own import hooks as the new first item of the :attr:`sys.meta_path`
       list. The import hook previously prepended by :mod:`pytest` then becomes
       the second item  of the :attr:`sys.meta_path` list. Python consults both
       the :attr:`sys.meta_path` and :attr:`sys.path_hooks` lists in a
       first-come-first-served manner. The first hook on each list satisfying a
       request to find and import a module being imported terminates that
       request; no subsequent hooks are consulted. Both :mod:`typeguard` and
       :mod:`ideas` fail to iteratively consult subsequent hooks (e.g., with a
       piggybacking scheme of some sort). Both squelch the hook previously
       installed by :mod:`pytest` that rewrote assertions. That is bad.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _conf_beartype_if_module_hooked : Optional[BeartypeConf]
        Either:

        * If the most recent call to the :meth:`get_code` method (which loads a
          module by creating and return the code object underlying that module)
          was passed the fully-qualified name of a module with a transitive
          parent package previously registered by a call to a public
          :mod:`beartype.claw` import hook factory (e.g.,
          :func:`beartype.claw.beartype_package`), the beartype configuration
          with which to type-check that module.
        * Else, :data:`None`.

        This instance variable enables our override of the parent
        :meth:`get_code` method to communicate this configuration to the child
        :meth:`source_to_code` method, which fails to accept and thus has *no*
        access to this module name. The superclass implementation of the
        :meth:`get_code` method then internally calls our override of the
        :meth:`source_to_code` method, which accesses this instance variable to
        decide whether and how to type-check that module.

        Ordinarily, this approach would be fraught with fragility. For example,
        what if something *other* than the :meth:`get_code` method called the
        :meth:`source_to_code` method? Thankfully, that is *not* a concern here.
        :meth:`source_to_code` is only called by :meth:`get_code` in the
        :mod:`importlib` codebase. Ergo, :meth:`source_to_code` should ideally
        have been privatized (e.g., as ``_source_to_code()``).

        This override of the superclass :meth:`SourceLoader.get_code` method

        depending on whether a parent package transitively containing that

        :mod:`beartype.claw._pkg.clawpkghook` submodule (e.g., by a call to the

        * If *no* parent package transitively containing that module has been
          registered, this method fully defers to the superclass
          :meth:`SourceLoader.get_code` method.

          have been registered. In this case, this method (in order):

          #. Temporarily monkey-patches (i.e., replaces) the
             private :func:`importlib._bootstrap_external.cache_from_source`
             function with our beartype-specific
             :func:`_cache_from_source_beartype` variant.
          #. Calls the superclass :meth:`SourceLoader.get_code` method, which:

             #. Calls our override of the lower-level superclass
                :meth:`SourceLoader.source_to_code` method.

          #. Restores the
             :func:`importlib._bootstrap_external.cache_from_source` function to
             its original implementation.

        Motivation
        ----------
        The temporary monkey-patch applied by this method is strongly inspired
        by a suspiciously similar temporary monkey-patch applied by the external
        :meth:`typeguard.importhook.TypeguardLoader.exec_module` method authored
        by the incomparable @agronholm (Alex Gr√∂nholm), who writes:

            Use a custom optimization marker ‚Äì the import lock should make
            this monkey patch safe

        The aforementioned "custom optimization marker" is, in fact, a
        beartype-specific constant embedded in the filename of the cached Python
        bytecode file to which that module is byte-compiled. This filename
        typically resembles
        ``__pycache__/{module_basename}.{optimization_markers}.pyc``, where:

        * ``{module_basename}`` is the unqualified basename of that module.
        * ``{optimization_markers}`` is a ``"-"``-delimited string of
          **optimization markers** (i.e., arbitrary alphanumeric labels
          uniquifying this bytecode file to various bytecode-specific metadata,
          including the name and version of the active Python interpreter).

        This monkey-patch suffixing ``{optimization_markers}`` with the
        substring ``"-beartype-{BEARTYPE_VERSION}"``, which additionally
        uniquifies the filename of this bytecode file to the abstract syntax
        tree (AST) transformation applied by this version of :mod:`beartype`.
        Why? Because external callers can trivially enable and disable that
        transformation for any module by either calling or not calling the
        :func:`beartype.claw.beartype_package` function with the name of a
        package transitively containing that module. Compiling a @beartyped
        module to the same bytecode file as the non-@beartyped variant of that
        module would erroneously persist @beartyping to that module -- even
        *after* removing the relevant call to the
        :func:`beartype.claw.beartype_package` function! Clearly, that's awful.
        Enter @agronholm's phenomenal patch, stage left.

        We implicitly trust @agronholm to get that right in a popular project
        stress-tested across hundreds of open-source projects over the past
        several decades. So, we avoid explicit thread-safe locking here.

        Lastly, note there appears to be *no* other means of safely
        implementing this behaviour *without* violating Don't Repeat Yourself
        (DRY). Specifically, doing so would require duplicating most of the
        entirety of the *extremely* non-trivial nearly 100 line-long
        :meth:`importlib._bootstrap_external.SourceLoader.get_code` method.
        Since duplicating non-trivial and fragile code inherently tied to a
        specific CPython version is considerably worse than applying a trivial
        one-line monkey-patch, first typeguard and now @beartype strongly prefer
        this monkey-patch. Did we mention that @agronholm is amazing? Because
        that really bears repeating. May the name of Alex Gr√∂nholm live eternal!
