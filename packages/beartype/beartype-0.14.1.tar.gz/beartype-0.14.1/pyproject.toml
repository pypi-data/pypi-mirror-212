# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Project-wide packager-agnostic configuration. Unlike all other top-level
# configuration files (e.g., "setup.py", "MANIFEST.in") specific to some
# utility in Python's package management ecosystem (e.g., "pip", "setuptools"),
# this file strictly conforms to a standards-compliant PEP and hence
# generically applies to *ALL* such utilities.
#
# Welcome to project distribution hell, where only twenty distinct files in
# twenty distinct formats suffice to distribute a single project.
#
# --------------------( MOTIVATION                         )--------------------
# This configuration is now required in various edge cases to avoid fatal errors
# under Python's modern build toolchain. Notably, "pip" now refuses to install
# this project under containerized environments (e.g., Docker, which the popular
# documentation host ReadTheDocs (RTD) leverages) with extremely verbose and
# thus mostly unreadable fatal errors resembling:
#     Processing /home/docs/checkouts/readthedocs.org/user_builds/beartype/checkouts/latest
#       Preparing metadata (setup.py): started
#       Preparing metadata (setup.py): finished with status 'error'
#       error: subprocess-exited-with-error
#
#       × python setup.py egg_info did not run successfully.
#       │ exit code: 1
#       ╰─> [1 lines of output]
#           ERROR: Can not execute `setup.py` since setuptools is not available in the build environment.
#           [end of output]
#
#       note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.
#     error: metadata-generation-failed
#
#     × Encountered error while generating package metadata.
#     ╰─> See above for output.
#
#     note: This is an issue with the package mentioned above, not pip.
#     hint: See above for details.

# List of all Python packages required to build (i.e., install) this project
# from both codebase tarballs and binary wheels.
#
# Note that:
# * Setuptools 50.0 is fundamentally broken in numerous ways (including ways
#   that both break and do not break installation of this project) and *MUST*
#   thus be blacklisted. See also:

# Explicitly notify "pip" that we leverage the top-level "setuptools"-backed
# "setup.py" script as our installation infrastructure.
#
# Note that this is explicitly required for temporary backward compatibility
# with "pip" 19.1.0, which erroneously violated PEP 51{7,8} by failing to
# fallback to a sane default value in the absence of this setting. If this
# setting is left unspecified here, "pip" 19.1.0 fails on attempting to perform
# an editable (i.e., developer-specific) install with the following error:
#     $ pip3 install --user --editable .
#     Obtaining file:///home/leycec/py/betse
#     ERROR: Error installing 'file:///home/leycec/py/betse': editable mode is
#     not supported for pyproject.toml-style projects. pip is processing this
#     project as pyproject.toml-style because it has a pyproject.toml file.
#     Since the project has a setup.py and the pyproject.toml has no
#     "build-backend" key for the "build_system" value, you may pass
#     --no-use-pep517 to opt out of pyproject.toml-style processing. See PEP
#     517 for details on pyproject.toml-style projects.
