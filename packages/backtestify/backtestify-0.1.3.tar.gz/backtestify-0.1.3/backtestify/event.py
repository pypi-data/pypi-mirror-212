class Event:
    """
    The Event class is a base class that represents an abstract event in a trading system.
    It can be extended by other classes to represent specific types of events (e.g., MarketEvent, SignalEvent, OrderEvent).

    Attributes:
        event_type (str): A string describing the type of event.
        timestamp (datetime.datetime, optional): A datetime object representing the time at which the event occurred. Defaults to None.
        symbol (str, optional): A string representing the ticker symbol of the security involved in the event. Defaults to None.
