## Introduction
While there are already backtesting tools available, I aimed to create a tool that allows for more accurate backtesting specifically for Contract for Difference (CFD). My vision was to create a comprehensive tool that takes care of the entire backtesting process, where the trader can focus solely on strategy formulation and testing new strategies without needing to invest time in coding. This tool is envisioned to be user-friendly and fully open-source, similar to other strategy analysis builders available on the market, but with the added benefit of being completely free.

While platforms like MetaTrader 5 allow for backtesting strategies using technical indicators, they often fall short when it comes to applying advanced techniques such as machine learning. Such processes can be complicated and tedious. By creating a backtester directly in Python, this process is significantly simplified, and it also opens up the possibility of utilizing all kinds of existing Python modules.
