def intensity_center(arr, csquare=20, cintensity=0.8):
    '''
    Find center of intensity/mass of an array.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : 2D-numpy array
        The array, whose intensity center will be determined.
    csquare : int, optional, default is 20
        The size/edge of the square in the (geometrical) center.
        The intensity center will be searched only within the central square.
        Reasons: To avoid other spots/diffractions and
        to minimize the effect of possible intensity assymetry around center. 
    cintensity : float, optional, default is 0.8
        The intensity fraction.
        When searching the intensity center, we will consider only
        pixels with intensity > max.intensity.
        
    Returns
    -------
    xc,yc : int,int
        XY-coordinate of the intensity/mass center of the array.
