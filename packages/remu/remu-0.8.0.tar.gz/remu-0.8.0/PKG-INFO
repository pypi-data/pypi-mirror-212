Setup
=====

Installing development version from source
------------------------------------------

It is recommended to run this software in a virtual Python environment
(virtualenv). This ensures that all required packages are present in the tested
version and do not interfere with other packages installed on the system. The
easiest way to do so, is to simply source ``setup.sh`` after checking out the
source code::

    $ . setup.sh

This will automatically do something along these lines::

    $ # Create a new virtual environment
    $ virtualenv ENV
    $ # Activate the environment
    $ . ENV/bin/activate
    $ # Upgrade pip to the latest version (optional)
    $ pip install --upgrade pip
    $ # Install all required packages
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ # Install actual package
    $ pip install -e .

It will only create a new virtual environment if one does not exist already.
You can also specify which Python version to use by providing the respective
``virtualenv`` argument to ``setup.sh``, e.g. ``. setup.sh -p python3``. You
might need to install additional system libraries to compile all packages.

ReMU requires Python >=3.7.

Installing official releases with ``pip``
-----------------------------------------

Alternatively you can install official releases directly with ``pip``::

    $ # Create a new virtual environment
    $ virtualenv ENV
    $ # Activate the environment
    $ . ENV/bin/activate
    $ # Upgrade pip to the latest version (optional)
    $ pip install --upgrade pip
    $ # Install remu and its dependencies
    $ pip install remu==1.0.0

If you want to make sure the optional dependencies are also installed,
use pip's 'Extras' syntax::

    $ # install remu including all optional dependencies
    $ pip install remu[mcmc]==1.0.0

Tests
=====

Run all test cases of the framework::

    $ pip install -r test-requirements.txt
    $ ./run_tests.sh
