options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        Path to the .csv-log-file generated by
                        InternetSpeedVisualizer.
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Path to the line-graph-image that should be created.
  --width WIDTH         Width in inch of the output image. (default: 20)
  --height HEIGHT       Height in inch of the output image. (default: 10)
  -d <min>;<max>, --download <min>;<max>
                        Download speed promised by the ISP. (default:
                        "180;250")
  -u <min>;<max>, --upload <min>;<max>
                        Upload speed promised by the ISP. (default: "35;40")
  --interactive         Show an interactive line-graph. (default: False)
  -no, --no_overwrite   Set this flag to automatically select a similar
                        output-filename, so a potentially already existing
                        file will not be overwritten.

Passing only minimum download speed:
    --download "200;"
Passing only maximum download speed:
    --download ";250"
Passing only minimum upload speed:
    --upload "30;"
Passing only maximum upload speed:
    --upload ";40"
```

## Sample output

Given a sample .csv-file names `internet_speeds.csv`, the following command
generates the following image:

```
InternetSpeedVisualizer -i internet_speeds.csv -o internet_speeds.png -d "180;250" -u "30;40"
```

## Companion Tool: InternetSpeedLogger

InternetSpeedVisualizer is designed to work in harmony with
[InternetSpeedLogger](https://github.com/Andreas-Menzel/InternetSpeedLogger).
This companion tool allows you to continuously log your internet speed at
defined intervals.

By saving the data in a CSV file,
[InternetSpeedLogger](https://github.com/Andreas-Menzel/InternetSpeedLogger)
provides you with a historical log of your internet speeds. This data can then
be visualized using InternetSpeedVisualizer, enabling you to understand trends
and fluctuations in your internet speed over time.
