# ðŸš€ Notebook Copilot: From Thoughts to Well-Crafted Code at Record-Speed.

Welcome to Notebook Copilot, your next-generation tool for Jupyter Notebooks. Inspired by GitHub Copilot, Notebook
Copilot is designed to help engineers and data scientists in developing professional, high-quality notebooks. It's like
having your personal AI-powered assistant that helps you navigate through the Jupyter universe, seamlessly
generating code and markdown cells based on your inputs.

Imagine not having to start with a blank notebook every time. Sounds dreamy, right?

## Key Features

- **`%copilot` magic function**: Continues the notebook for you, generating professional code and markdown cells, making
  blank notebooks a thing of the past.
- **`%generate` magic function**: Utilizes AI to generate the next cell from your comments. Just give it a hint, and
  it'll do the heavy lifting for you.
- **`%explain` magic function**: Produces a markdown cell that elaborates the functionality of the current cell. Don't
  just write code, understand it thoroughly!

## Installation

You can install Notebook Copilot directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install notebook_copilot
```

## Usage
Load the Notebook Copilot extension in your Jupyter notebook:

```python
%load_ext notebook_copilot
```

Now you're ready to use the magic functions:

```python
# Enter Assistant Mode, will continue the notebook for you
%copilot
```

```python
# Generate the next cell code
%%generate plot the confusion matrix using for the model
```

```python
# Explain the current cell
%%explain
# some codeâ€¦
```

## Roadmap

- [x] **Copilot Magic Function**: Continues the notebook for you, generating professional code and markdown cells, making
  blank notebooks a thing of the past.
- [x] **Generate Magic Function**: Turn Your Comments into Code
- [x] **Explain Magic Function**: Generate Markdown Cells that Explain Your Code
- [ ] Update underlying strategy to ToT
