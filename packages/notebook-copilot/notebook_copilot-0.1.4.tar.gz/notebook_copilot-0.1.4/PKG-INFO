# üöÄ Notebook Copilot: From Thoughts to Well-Crafted Notebook at Record-Speed. 

Welcome to Notebook Copilot, your next-generation tool for Jupyter Notebooks. Inspired by GitHub Copilot, Notebook
Copilot is designed to help engineers and data scientists in developing professional, high-quality notebooks. It's like
having your personal AI-powered assistant that helps you navigate through the Jupyter universe, seamlessly
generating code and markdown cells based on your inputs.

Imagine not having to start with a blank notebook every time. Sounds dreamy, right?

## Features

- üöÄ GPT Based Generation: Notebook Copilot employs advanced GPT instances for precise and efficient code generation.
- üíª Integrated with Any Notebook Environments: Seamless access within Jupyter Notebook and other popular platforms, boosting your productivity.
- üß© Automatic Context Retrieval: Understands the full context of your notebook, ensuring consistent and relevant code generation.
- üîë Bring Your Own OpenAI Key: Flexibility to use your own OpenAI key for personalized code generation and optimal results.
- üÜì Free and Open Source: Everyone can benefit from Notebook Copilot. It's our contribution to the coding community, aiming to make coding accessible, efficient, and fun.


## Quickstart
0. Get an OpenAI [API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
1. Install Notebook Copilot directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install notebook_copilot
```

2. Load the Notebook Copilot extension in your Jupyter notebook:

```python
%load_ext notebook_copilot

# Optional: If you don't have OPENAI_API_KEY set in your environment, you can set it here
from getpass import getpass
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass("Enter your OpenAI Key: ")

%copilot_init -n /Users/tp/dev/workspace/notebook_copilot/copilot_example_notebook.ipynb # improves copilot performance
```

3. Start using Notebook Copilot Magic Functions in your notebook ‚Üì


## ‚ú® Magic Functions

ü™Ñ Enter Assistant Mode and let Copilot continuously generate professional code and markdown cells for you.
```python
%copilot
```

‚úçÔ∏è Leverage AI to create the next cell from your comments. It's like having a conversation with your notebook.

```python
%%generate 
# Plot the confusion matrix using for the model
```

üìò Automatically generate markdown cells to explain the code in the current cell. Your code is now not only functional but also well-documented.
```python
%%explain
# some code to explain‚Ä¶
```

## Roadmap

- [x] **Copilot Magic Function**: Continues the notebook for you, generating professional code and markdown cells, making
