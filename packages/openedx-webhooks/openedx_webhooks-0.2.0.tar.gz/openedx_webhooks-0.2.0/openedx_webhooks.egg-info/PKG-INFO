Purpose
*******

Webhooks for Open edX

This plugin implements a generic case of events handling that
trigger a request to a configurable URL when a signal is received.

Getting Started
***************

Developing
==========

More information about available signals can be found in the `events documentation`_
and the `filters documentation`_

.. _events documentation: https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/blob/master/docs/guides/hooks/events.rst
.. _filters documentation: https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/blob/master/docs/guides/hooks/filters.rst


One Time Setup
--------------
.. code-block::

  # Clone the repository
  git clone git@github.com:aulasneo/openedx-webhooks.git
  cd openedx-webhooks

  # Set up a virtualenv with the same name as the repo and activate it
  # Here's how you might do that if you have virtualenvwrapper setup.
  mkvirtualenv -p python3.8 openedx-webhooks


Every time you develop something in this repo
---------------------------------------------
.. code-block::

  # Activate the virtualenv
  # Here's how you might do that if you're using virtualenvwrapper.
  workon openedx-webhooks

  # Grab the latest code
  git checkout main
  git pull

  # Install/update the dev requirements
  make requirements

  # Run the tests and quality checks (to verify the status before you make any changes)
  make validate

  # Make a new branch for your changes
  git checkout -b <your_github_username>/<short_description>

  # Using your favorite editor, edit the code to make your change.
  vim ...

  # Run your new tests
  pytest ./path/to/new/tests

  # Run all the tests and quality checks
  make validate

  # Commit all your changes
  git commit ...
  git push

  # Open a PR and ask for review.

Deploying
=========

To install this plugin into an Open edX installed by Tutor add this line
to the `OPENEDX_EXTRA_PIP_REQUIREMENTS` list.

.. code-block::

    - git+https://github.com/aulasneo/openedx-webhooks

If it is an existing installation, you might need to run migrations to create
the database table. For this, run:

.. code-block::

     tutor {dev|local|k8s} exec lms ./manage.py lms migrate

Configuring
===========

A new section named `Webhooks` will be available in the LMS Django admin site.
Add a new webhook to define the URLs that will be called after each event is
received. More than one URL can be configured for each event. In this case,
all URLs will be called.
