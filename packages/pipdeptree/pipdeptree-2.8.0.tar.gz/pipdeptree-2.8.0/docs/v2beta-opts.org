* Options in version 0.x v/s 2.x (upcoming release)

Until version 0.13.2, the some of the options that pipdeptree supports
didn't work in combination with other options. In fact this was the
primary reason behind refactoring the code.

The upcoming version 2.x plans to fix this as shown in the tables below.

Note: The changes for upcoming 2.x release can be found in the
~v2beta~ branch.

** Until version 0.13.2
