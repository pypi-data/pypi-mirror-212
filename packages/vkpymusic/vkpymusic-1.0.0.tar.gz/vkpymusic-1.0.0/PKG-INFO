# Description
## VKpyMusic 
### is a Python library that provides a simple interface for interacting with the VKontakte (VK) music service API. The library allows developers to easily perform operations related to music and other functionalities available through the VK API.

# Installation
### You can install VKpyMusic using the pip package manager. Open your command prompt or terminal and execute the following command:

### Console:
```
pip install vkpymusic
```

# Usage
### To get started with VKpyMusic, you will need a valid VK access token and user agent, which provides access to the VK music service API. But if you don't have them, it's okay - we have our own class to get it.

## Example usage of VKpyMusic for receive token and user agent:
### Python:
```
from vkpymusic import TokenReceiver

login = input("   Enter login: ")
password = input("Enter password: ")

tokenReceiver = TokenReceiver(login, password)

if tokenReceiver.auth():
    tokenReceiver.get_token()
    tokenReceiver.save_to_config()
```
## Create an Service instance with your access token and user agent:
### Python:
```
from vkpymusic.MusicService import Service

service = Service.parse_config()
```
## Or you can do like this
### Python:
```
service = Service("<your_token>", "<your_client>")
```

## Get information about the current user
### Python:
```
user_songs = service.get_songs_by_userid(7);
print(user_info)
```
# Search for tracks by query
### Python:
```
tracks = service.search('Coldplay')
print(tracks)
```
