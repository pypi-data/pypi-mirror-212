# rbatools

This tool serves as an interface to resource-allocation modelling with the RBA-method (https://rba.inrae.fr).
It includes methods to solve, manipulate and analyse RBA-models and to export model information and simulation results into various formats.

The code and teaching materials, including a sample model for B.subtilis, can be found at https://github.com/SysBioInra/rbatools 

RBA models can be obtained from the repository https://github.com/SysBioInra/Bacterial-RBA-models

Information on RBA can be found at https://rba.inrae.fr and on rbatools at https://rba.inrae.fr/rbatools
