Installation

Usage
-----

Like any other gemseo wrapped solver, MMA solver can be called setting the algo option to ``"MMA"``.
This algorithm can be used for single objective continuous optimization problem with non-linear inequality constraints.

Advanced options:

* tol: The KKT residual norm tolerance. This is not the one implemented in GEMSEO as it uses the local functions to be computed.

* max_optimization_step: Also known as ``move`` parameter control the maximum distance of the next iteration design point from the current one. Reducing this parameter avoid divergence for highly non-linear problems.

* min_asymptote_distance: The minimum distance of the asymptotes from the current design variable value.

* max_asymptote_distance: The maximum distance of the asymptotes from the current design variable value.

* initial_asymptotes_distance: The initial asymptote distance from the current design variable value.

* asymptotes_distance_amplification_coefficient The incremental factor of asymptote distance from the current design variable value for successful iterations.

* asymptotes_distance_reduction_coefficient: The decremental factor of asymptote distance from the current design variable value for successful iterations.

* conv_tol: If provided control all other convergence tolerances.

The shortest is the distance of the asymptotes, the highest is the convexity of the local approximation.
It's another mechanism to control the optimization step.
You can find an example in examples/analytic_example.ipynb.
