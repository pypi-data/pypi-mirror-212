# EncryptedHTTP
A secure encrypted way for a server to communicate to a local client without HTTPS.

# Introduction

The EncryptedHTTP package is designed to provide a secure and encrypted communication channel between a server and a local client using the HTTP protocol. Inspired by the principles of HTTPS, this package imitates its functionality to ensure confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over an insecure network. By leveraging cryptographic algorithms and secure authentication mechanisms, EncryptedHTTP enables developers to establish a trusted connection between the server and client, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access and tampering. The EncryptedHTTP package uses strong encryption methods to ensure that data transferred between a server and a local client cannot be accessed by a third-party.

# Precautions

While EncryptedHTTP enhances security within the confines of the HTTP protocol, it’s important to remember that it does not offer the same level of security as the established HTTPS standard, which provides additional safeguards against various attacks and ensures trust through certificate authorities.

A few problems yet to fixed in the EncryptedHTTP package are as follows:

1. Lack of Server-Side Storage Security _(Is replaceable with custom Server-Side Storage Functions)_
2. Lack of Session Management _(Planned to Fix)_
3. Limited Authentication Mechanisms _(Planned to Fix)_
4. Susceptibility to Man-in-the-middle Attacks and Impersonations

The above problems will be looked upon in the next update.

# Installation

The EncryptedHTTP package can be installed by cloning the repository.
It will soon be available for installation on `pip`.

# Usage

**Example 1**

server.py:

```
from flask import Flask
from EncryptedHTTP.server import Auth as ServerAuth
 
app = Flask(__name__)
server = ServerAuth(app=app, token_file=”./tokens.json”, server_name=”Test Server”, server_location=”US”)

server.register_auth_routes()

@server.route(rule=”/”, headers_to_accept=[‘key’], key_not_found=’return Invalid Headers to Client’, include_token=False, methods=[‘GET’])
def home(headers, *args, **kwargs):
  # Do something with the headers
  return json.dumps(data)

if __name__ == “__main__”:
  app.run()
```

client.py:

```
from EncryptedHTTP.client import Auth as ClientAuth

client = ClientAuth(url=”server_url”, session_file=”./session.json”)
client.auth(name=”Client”, location=”US”)

headers = {‘key’: ‘val’}

response: dict = client.make_request(method=’GET’, endpoint=”/”, headers=headers)
```

**Example 2**

server.py:

```
from flask import Flask
from EncryptedHTTP.server import Auth as ServerAuth
 
app = Flask(__name__)
server = ServerAuth(app=app, token_file=”./tokens.json”, server_name=”Test Server”, server_location=”US”)

server.register_auth_routes()

@server.route(rule=”/<param>”, headers_to_accept=[‘key’], key_not_found=’return Invalid Headers to Client’, include_token=False, methods=[‘GET’])
def home(headers, *args, **kwargs):
  param = kwargs['param']
  # Do something with the headers
  return json.dumps(data)

if __name__ == “__main__”:
  app.run()
```

client.py:

```
from EncryptedHTTP.client import Auth as ClientAuth

client = ClientAuth(url=”server_url”, session_file=”./session.json”)
client.auth(name=”Client”, location=”US”)

headers = {‘key’: ‘val’}

response: dict = client.make_request(method=’GET’, endpoint=”/value”, headers=headers)
```
