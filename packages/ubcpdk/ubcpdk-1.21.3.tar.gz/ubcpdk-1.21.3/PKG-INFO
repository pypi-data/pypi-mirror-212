SiEPIC Ebeam PDK adapted from [siepic Ebeam PDK](https://github.com/lukasc-ubc/SiEPIC_EBeam_PDK) for gdsfactory.
It provides a fully python driven flow alternative for the most advanced users taking the [edx course](https://www.edx.org/course/silicon-photonics-design-fabrication-and-data-ana)

## Installation

### Installation for new python users

If you don't have python installed on your system you can [download the gdsfactory installer](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory/releases) with python3, miniconda and all gdsfactory plugins.

### Installation for new gdsfactory users

If you already have python installed. Open Anaconda Prompt and then install the ubcpdk using pip.
