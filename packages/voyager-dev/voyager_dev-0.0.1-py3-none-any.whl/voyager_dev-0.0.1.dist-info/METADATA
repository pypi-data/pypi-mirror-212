## ✨ Coding Assistant ✨


This project aims to develop a usable coding agent, which will work iteratively in collaboration with a developer.

At the current time, BabyAgi/AutoGPT approaches are too unstable to be of very much assistance. However, there is every reason to develop an agent that learns from its environment, from its mistakes, and from your chat history, and develops tools as needed (Voyager).

# Usage

You can install this from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/voyager-dev/) with `pip install voyager_dev`.

Alternatively, you can clone this repository. Then to install this repository as a global Python CLI tool, run `pip install -e .`

Either way, you should also put your OpenAI and Google Search API keys in your .bashrc or .zshrc file, like this:

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=yourkeyhere
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=yourkeyhere
export GOOGLE_CSE_ID=yourkeyhere
```

You can get the latter two by creating the GOOGLE_API_KEY in the [Google Cloud credential console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and a GOOGLE_CSE_ID using the [Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/create). Examine the output carefully the first time you run it, Google may return a detailed error telling you how to fix it.

After that, you can simply type `voyager_dev` anywhere on the command line.
