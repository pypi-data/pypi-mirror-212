This package is for ordinal numbers. Ordered numbers are a concept from set theory that extends the natural numbers to compare the "length" of aligned sets. This library implements ordered numbers: sum, difference (left-hand inverse), product, quotient (left-hand inverse), truncation, division, remainder, comparison of sizes, square root, etc. If I have enough power, I will also create "log", "n-square root" and "factorial". If requested, I will make others. (my Email:alphagameplayerpro$gmail.com (please replace $ to @))
And,
```
omega = ordinal_number.OMEGA
```
at the beginning of the program. That way, it is intuitive and the output of repr() can be executed as is.
