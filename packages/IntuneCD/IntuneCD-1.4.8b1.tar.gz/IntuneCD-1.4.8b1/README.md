IntuneCD or, Intune Continuous Delivery as it stands for is a Python package that is used to back up and update configurations in Intune. It was created with running it from a pipeline in mind. Using this approach we get complete history of which configurations have been changed and what setting has been changed.

The main function is to back up configurations from Intune to a Git repository from a DEV environment and if any configurations has changed, push them to PROD Intune environment.

The package can also be run standalone outside a pipeline, or in one to only backup data.
