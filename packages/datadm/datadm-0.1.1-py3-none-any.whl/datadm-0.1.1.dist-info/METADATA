![dataDM](datadm-header.png?raw=true)

DataDM is your private data assistant. A conversational interface for your data where you can load, clean, transform, and visualize without a single line of code. DataDM is open source and can be run entirely locally, keeping your juicy data secrets fully private. Slide into your data's DMs tonight.

## Demo

[ recorded demo video here ]

## Features
- [x] Persistent Juptyer kernel backend for data manipulation during conversation
- [x] Run entirely locally, keeping your data private
- [x] Natural language chat, visualizations/plots, and direct download of data assets
- [x] Easy to use docker-images for one-line deployment
- [x] Load multiple tables directly into the chat
- [x] Option to use OpenAI's GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 (requires API key)
- [ ] [WIP] GGML based mode (CPU only, no GPU required) [/WIP]

## Things you can ask DataDM
- [x] Load data from a URL
- [x] Clean data by removing duplicates, nulls, outliers, etc.
- [x] Join data from multiple tables into a single output table
- [x] Visualize data with plots and charts
- [x] Ask whatever you want to your very own private code-interpreter

## Quickstart

You can use docker, colab, or install locally.

### 1. Docker to run locally
```bash
docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY={{YOUR_API_KEY_HERE}} -p 7860:7860 -it ghcr.io/approximatelabs/datadm:latest
```

For local-mode using StarChat model (requiring a CUDA device with at least 24GB of RAM)
```bash
docker run --gpus all -p 7860:7860 -it ghcr.io/approximatelabs/datadm:0.1.0-cuda
```

### 2. Colab to run in the cloud

### 3. Install and Run

For local-data, cloud-model mode (no GPU required) - requires an OpenAI API key
```bash
$ pip install datadm
$ datadm
```

For local-mode using StarChat model (requiring a CUDA device with at least 24GB of RAM)
```bash
$ pip install "datadm[cuda]"
$ datadm
```
