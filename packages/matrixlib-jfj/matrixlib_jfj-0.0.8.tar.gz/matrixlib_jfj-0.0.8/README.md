# Matrixlib
A basic library for matrix and vector operations. Any feedback is highly encouraged. I enjoy trying to create modules and programs that work with mathematical functions and data. I also like looking into higher end modules and researching the processes and programs they use to perform tasks. Any feedback will be taken and acted upon.

# Update 0.0.7
Added "get_submatrix" function that gets the submatrix of any square matrix, added the "det" function which gets the determinant of a square matrix.

# Update 0.0.8
Fixed bug where an external program would run when the user of the package would run their own program.
