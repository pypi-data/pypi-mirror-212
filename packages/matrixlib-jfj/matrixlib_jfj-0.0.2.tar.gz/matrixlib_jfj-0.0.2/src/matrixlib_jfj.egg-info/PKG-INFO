# Matrixlib
A basic library for matrix and vector operations. Any feedback is highly encouraged. I enjoy trying to create modules and programs that work with mathematical functions and data. I also like looking into higher end modules and researching the processes and programs they use to perform tasks. Any feedback will be taken and acted upon.
