The complete schema of a fully-populated database appears below.

Direct SQL queries can also be performed on the Crossref data set.

Queries involving multiple scans of the tables (e.g.Â relational joins)
should be performed by directing *alexandria3k* to perform them
separately in each partition. This however means that aggregation
operations will not work as expected, because they will be run multiple
times (once for every partition).
