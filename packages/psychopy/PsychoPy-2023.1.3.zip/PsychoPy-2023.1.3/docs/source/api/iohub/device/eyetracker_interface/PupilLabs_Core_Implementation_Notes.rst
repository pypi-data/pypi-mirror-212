High Level Pupil Core Introduction
**********************************

`Pupil Core <https://pupil-labs.com/products/core/>`__ is a wearable eye tracker. The
system consists of two inward-facing eye cameras and one forward-facing world camera
mounted on a wearable eyeglasses-like frame.

Pupil Core provides gaze data in its world camera's field of view, regardless of the wearer's
head position. As such, gaze can be analysed with the wearer looking and moving freely
in their environment.

Pupil Core differs from remote eye trackers often used with |PsychoPy|. Remote eye
trackers employ cameras mounted on or near a computer monitor. They provide gaze in
screen-based coordinates, and this facilitates closed-loop analyses of gaze based on the
known position of stimuli on-screen and eye gaze direction.

In order to use Pupil Core for screen-based work in |PsychoPy|, the screen will need to be
robustly located within the world camera's field of view, and Pupil Core's gaze data
subsequently transformed from world camera-based coordinates to screen-based coordinates.
This is achieved with the use of
`AprilTag Markers <https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/software/pupil-capture/#markers>`__.

Device, Software, and Connection Setup
**************************************

Additional Software Requirements
================================

`Pupil Capture <https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil/releases/latest>`_
version v2.0 or newer

Platforms:

-  Windows 10
-  macOS 10.14 or newer
-  Ubuntu 16.04 or newer

Supported Models:

-  Pupil Core headset

Setting Up the Eye Tracker
==========================

1. Follow `Pupil Core's Getting Started
   guide <https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/#getting-started>`__ to setup
   the headset and Capture software

Setting Up |PsychoPy|
=====================

1. Open ``experiment settings`` in the Builder Window (cog icon in top
   panel)
2. Open the ``Eyetracking`` tab
3. Modify the properties as follows:

   -  Select ``Pupil Labs`` from the ``Eyetracker Device`` drop down menu
   -  ``Pupil Remote Address`` / ``Port`` - Defines how to connect to
      Pupil Capture. See Pupil Capture's *Network API* menu to check
      address and port are correct. |PsychoPy| will wait the amount of
      milliseconds declared in ``Pupil Remote Timeout (ms)`` for the
      connection to be established. An error will be raised if the
      timeout is reached.
   -  ``Pupil Capture Recording`` - Enable this option to tell Pupil
      Capture to record the eye tracker's raw data during the
      experiment. You can read more about that in `Pupil Capture's
      official
      documentation <https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/software/pupil-capture/#recording>`__.
      Leave ``Pupil Capture Recording Location`` empty to record to the
      default
   -  ``Gaze Confidence Threshold`` - Set the minimum data quality
      received from Pupil Capture. Ranges from 0.0 (all data) to 1.0
      (highest possible quality). We recommend using the default value
      of 0.6.
   -  ``Pupillometry Only`` - If this mode is selected you will only
      receive pupillometry data. No further setup is required. If you
      are interested in gaze data, keep this option disabled and read on
      below.

Pupillometry + Gaze Mode
========================

To receive gaze, enable Pupil Capture's Surface Tracking
plugin:

1. Start by `printing four apriltag
   markers <https://docs.pupil-labs.com/assets/img/apriltags_tag36h11_0-23.37196546.jpg>`__
   and attaching them at the screen corners. Avoid occluding the screen
   and leave sufficient white space around the marker squares. Read more
   about the
   `general marker setup here <https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/software/pupil-capture/#surface-tracking>`__.

        AprilTag markers

1. `Enable the surface tracker
   plugin <https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/software/pupil-capture/#plugins>`__
2. `Define a surface and align its surface
   corners <https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/software/pupil-capture/#defining-a-surface>`__
   with the screen corners as good as possible
3. Rename the surface to the name set in the ``Surface Name`` field of
   the eye tracking project settings (default:
   ``psychopy_iohub_surface``)
4. Run the |PsychoPy| calibration component as part of your experiment

Implementation and API Overview
*******************************

EyeTracker Class
================

.. autoclass:: psychopy.iohub.devices.eyetracker.hw.pupil_labs.pupil_core.EyeTracker
    :members: surface_topic, trackerTime, trackerSec, setConnectionState, isConnected,
        runSetupProcedure, setRecordingState, isRecordingEnabled, getLastSample, 
        getLastGazePosition
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:

Supported Event Types
=====================

The Pupil Coreâ€“|PsychoPy| integration provides real-time access to monocular and binocular
sample data. In pupillometry-only mode, all events will be emitted as
:py:class:`MonocularEyeSampleEvents <psychopy.iohub.devices.eyetracker.MonocularEyeSampleEvent>`.
In pupillometry+gaze mode, the software only emits :py:class:`BinocularEyeSampleEvents
<psychopy.iohub.devices.eyetracker.BinocularEyeSampleEvent>` events if Pupil Capture is
driving a binocular headset and the detection from both eyes have sufficient `confidence
<https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/terminology/#confidence>`_ to be paired. See this
high-level overview of the `Pupil Capture Data Matching algorithm
<https://github.com/N-M-T/pupil-docs/commit/1dafe298565720a4bb7500a245abab7a6a2cd92f>`_
