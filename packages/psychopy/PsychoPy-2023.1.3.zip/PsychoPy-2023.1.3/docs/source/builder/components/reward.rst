Reward Component
--------------

This component allows you to deliver a water reward to smalls animals (mice, rat) 
and monitor licks, using the peristaltic from Labeo Technologies Inc.


Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

Name : string
    Everything in a |PsychoPy| experiment needs a unique name. The name should contain only letters, numbers and underscores (no punctuation marks or spaces).

Start :
    The time that the firt pulse of the water reward occurs.

Stop :
    Governs the duration for which the water reward sequence is given.

Sync to screen : bool
    Choose to synchronize the reward operations (pulses) to the
    screen refresh. This ensures better synchronization with visual stimuli.

Pulse duration (s) :
    The duration of the pulse sent to the peristaltic pump. To know exactly the volume of water given,
    please perform a calibration curve, as the quantity depends of your experimental setup. Precision can
    go as low as 16.6 ms for a 60 Hz screen. 

Number of pulses :
    The number of pulses in a burst.

Delay between sequences (s) :
    A sequence is a burst sequence, so multiples pulses. This delay is the duration between theses sequences

Number of sequences : 
    The number of burst sequences occuring during the time the water reward component is enable in the experiment.

Delay between pulses (s) : 
    The time duration between pulses in a burst sequence.

Save actions of pump and licks to txt file : 
    Check if you want to save log events (pump ON, OFF, lick) to a .txt file, located in the data folder of the experiment. 

COM port : 
    Please specify the COM port (USB port) on which the pump is connected.
