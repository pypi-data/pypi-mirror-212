# Swagger Plugin for Sphinx

This is a handy plugin to bring [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) and [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) together.

It can generate one or multiple swagger HTML pages with a custom configuration that hosts an OpenAPI specification.

## Install

Just run `pip install swagger-plugin-for-sphinx`


## Usage

First, add the plugin to the extensions list:
```python
extensions = ["swagger_plugin_for_sphinx"]
```

Then add the main configuration for swagger:
```python
swagger_present_uri = ""
swagger_bundle_uri = ""
swagger_css_uri = ""
```
These correspond to the modules explained [here](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/docs/usage/installation.md).
By default, the latest release is used from [here](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swagger-ui-dist@latest).

As a last step, define the swagger configuration as follows:
```python
swagger = [
    {
        "name": "Service API",
        "page": "openapi",
        "options": {
            "url": "openapi.yaml",
        },
    }
]
```
Each item on the list will generate a new swagger HTML page.
The `name` is the HTML page name and `page` defines the file name without an extension. This needs to be included in the TOC.
The `options` are then used for the `SwaggerUIBundle` as defined [here](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md).
Please don't specify the `dom_id` since it's hardcoded in the HTML page.

In the sphinx build, an HTML page is created and put into the `_static` directory of the build.

If the specification is provided as a file, don't forget to copy it (e.g., by putting it into the `html_static_path`).

To silence the warning `toctree contains reference to nonexisting document`, just put a dummy file with the same name as `page` into the source folder.

## Build and Publish

This project uses `setuptools` as the dependency management and build tool.
To publish a new release, follow these steps:
* Update the version in the `pyproject.toml`
* Add an entry in the changelog
* Push a new tag like `vX.X.X` to trigger the release
