                When this hybrid node's `to_string` is called, it adds 
                itself to the pool automatically. If you want to 
                prevent that, pass `None` for this arg or override the 
                `handle_to_string()` function.   
            duplicates_count (int, optional): 
                duplicate counter -- counts how many other nodes 
                there exist with the same label. Defaults to 0.
            additional_info (dict, optional): 
                dictionary with all additional data you want to attach
                to the node (see also `to_string()`). Defaults to 
                dict().
            children (list, optional): 
                list of children nodes. Defaults to [].
                Please avoid using this if possible.
