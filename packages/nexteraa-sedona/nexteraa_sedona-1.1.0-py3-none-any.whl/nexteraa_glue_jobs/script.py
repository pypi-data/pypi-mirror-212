# script.py

import subprocess

# Step 1: Prepare your Python package

# Your package code and files should be organized in a proper directory structure.
# Ensure you have a setup.py file with the necessary metadata and dependencies.
# Create a README.md file to provide information about your package.

# Step 2: Build and package your Python package

# Run the following command to build your package
subprocess.run(["python", "setup.py", "sdist", "bdist_wheel"])

# Step 3: Upload to PyPI

# Install twine if not already installed
subprocess.run(["pip", "install", "twine"])

# Upload your package to PyPI
subprocess.run(["twine", "upload", "dist/*"])

# Step 4: Verify package availability

# Visit your package page on PyPI (e.g., https://pypi.org/project/your-package-name)
# to ensure it's available.

# Step 5: Referencing the package in Step Functions

# Update your Step Functions state machine definition to include the Python package
# as a dependency for your job. Make sure your AWS Glue job or Lambda function has the
# necessary configuration to fetch and use the package from PyPI during execution.
