# CodeZen

## Description

CodeZen is a CLI utility that uses LLMs to help you debug and evolve your codebase based on your requests.

Usage examples:
```bash
codezen "Why am I getting <some exception message>?"
codezen "Write a README.md file for this project"
```

The differences from Github Copilot:
* This is a CLI tool, meaning it can be used regardless of your chosen IDE.
* This provides the LLM with the entire codebase, so it can do things that require a more holistic view of your project.

Current limitations:
* Only works for small codebases- currently it sends the entire codebase on each request. ðŸ˜†
* It can't change files autonomously, it only offers a solution.
* It uses gitignore file to know which files to ignore, so you must run this in a git repo and you can't currently ignore files that don't appear there.
