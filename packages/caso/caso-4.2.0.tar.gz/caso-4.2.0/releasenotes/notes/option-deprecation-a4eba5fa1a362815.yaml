deprecations:
  - |
    All the `benchmark_*` and `accelerator_` option definitions in the
    `[DEFAULT]` section of the configuration file have been marked as
    deprecated, and are now included in the individual `[benchmark]` and
    `[acelerator]` sections, with the corresponding prefix (i.e. `benchmark_`
    and `accelerator_`) removed. Check the sample configuration file for more
    details.
