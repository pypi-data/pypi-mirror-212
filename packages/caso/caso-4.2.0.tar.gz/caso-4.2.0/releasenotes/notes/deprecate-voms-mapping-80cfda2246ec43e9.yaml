features:

    Allow loading VO mapping directly from Keystone. Instead of mainitaining a 
    separate file, we now allow users to load the VO directly from a configurable
    project property.
deprecations:
  - |
    The VO mapping file is now deprecated, in favour of project properties.
upgrade:
  - | 
    It is reccomended that you stop using the Keystone voms mapping file as
    soon as possible, please migrate your old JSON mapping to the new method
    using Keystone project's properties. In order to do so, you can use the 
    ``caso-mapping-migrate`` command line option, that will provide you with 
    the correct commands to run to perform the migration.
