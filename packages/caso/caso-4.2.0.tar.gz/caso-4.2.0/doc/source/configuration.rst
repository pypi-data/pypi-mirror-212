Configuration

OpenStack Configuration
=======================

Apart from configuring cASO, several actions need to be performed in your
OpenStack installation in order to be able to extract accounting records.

User credentials (required)
---------------------------

In the next section you will configure an OpenStack Keystone credentials in order to
extract the records. The cASO user has to be a member of each of the projects (another
option is to convert that user in an administrator, but the former option is a safer
approach) for which it is extracting the accounting, with the ``reader`` role (this is
a default OpenStack Keystone role). Otherwise, ``cASO`` will not be able to get the
usages and will fail::

    openstack user create --password <password> accounting
    # For each of the projects, add the user with the accounting role
    openstack role add --user accounting --project <project> reader

Moreover, you need to grant the user the role reader with a system scope of ``all`` in
order to get all the project tags, as well as the other user's information::

    openstack role add --system all --user accounting reader

Policy modifications
------------------------

.. important:: No policy modifications are needed

    The following policy modifications are just shown here for reference, if you wish to
    use a different role. You do not need to use them.

If you use the role ``reader`` as configured above, you do not need to configure
anything else in the policy. However, if you wish to use a different role mapping, the
accounting user needs access to Keystone so as to extract the users information.
Depending on your configuration, you need to modify the JSON policy file
(``/etc/keystone/policy.json``) or the YAML policy file (``/etc/keystone/policy-yaml``).
The modifications in the policy depend on the Keystone version, please ensure that you
are applying the correct changes as listed in the following table. In the example show,
we are using a dedicated role ``accounting``.

Selecting projects to get usages
================================

``cASO`` will extract project usages for those projects that have been explictly marked
by the operator by either of the ways explained below. The final project list will
result from the merge of both methods, so thay are not mutually exclusive.

* Tagging the project with the configured ``caso_tag`` in OpenStack Keystone. By default
  this option is set to ``caso``, so in order to mark a project to get extracted you
  should use the following command for each of the projects::

    openstack project set --tag caso <project id>

  You can check the list of projects to get usages by using::

    openstack project list --tags caso

* Using the ``projects`` list in the ``[DEFAULT]`` section of your configuration file
  (see below).

Setting VO mapping
------------------

In order to publish correct accounting records, ``cASO`` needs to know the VO that
should be used to publish the records from a given project. In order to do so, you need
to specify the correct mapping in each of the projects properties. The name of the
property that will be used is defined in the ``vo_property`` configuration option, and
defaults to ``accounting:VO``, therefore you can configure it as follows::

     openstack project set --property accounting:VO=<VO FQAN> <project id>

cASO configuration
==================

``cASO`` uses a config file (default at ``/etc/caso/caso.conf``) with several
sections. A sample file is available at
:download:`etc/caso/caso.conf.sample <static/caso.conf.sample>`.

``[DEFAULT]`` section
---------------------

The ``[DEFAULT]`` section configures the basic behavior of ``cASO``. The sample
config file (``/etc/caso/caso.conf.sample``) includes a description
of every option. You should check at least the following options:

* ``extractor`` (default value: ``nova``), specifies which extractor to use for
  getting the data. The following APIs are supported: ``ceilomenter`` and
  ``nova``. Both should generate equivalent information.
* ``site_name`` (default value: ``<None>``). Name of the site as defined in
  GOCDB.
* ``service_name`` (default value: ``$site_name``). Name of the service within
  a site. This is used if you have several endpoints within your site.
* ``projects`` (list value, default empty). List of the projects to extract
  records from. You can use either the project ID or the project name. We
  recommend that you use the project ID, especially if you are using
  domain-based authentication, as otherwise gathering the information might
  fail. This option, and the usage of ``caso_tag`` below will set up the final
  project list.
* ``caso_tag`` (default value: ``caso``), specified the tag to be used filter projects
  to extract their usage. The projects that are listed with this tag, as well as the
  ``projects`` list set above will set up the final project list. If you only use tags,
  and want to remove a project from being published, you just need to remove the tag
  from the project.
* ``messengers`` (list, default: ``noop``). List of the messengers to publish
  data to. Records will be pushed to all these messengers, in order. Valid
  messengers shipped with cASO are:

      * ``ssm`` for publishing APEL records.
      * ``logstash`` for publishing to Logstash.
      * ``noop`` do nothing at all.

  Note that there might be other messengers available in the system if they are
  registered into the ``caso.messenger`` entry point namespace. Please also note that
  versioning of the SSM messenger is deprecated.
* ``vo_property`` (default: ``accounting:VO``). The project that will be set in the
  OpenStack Keystone project to map a given project to a specific VO.
* **DEPRECATED** ``mapping_file`` (default: ``/etc/caso/voms.json``). File containing
  the mapping from VOs to local projects as configured in Keystone-VOMS, in the
  following form::

    {
        "VO": {
            "projects": ["foo", "bar"],
        }
    }

  Note that you have to use either the project ID or project name for the
  mapping, as configured in the ``projects`` configuration variable.

``[keystone_auth]`` section
---------------------------

This section is used to specify the authentication credentials to be used to
connect to the OpenStack APIs. cASO leverages the `OpenStack keystoneauth
<https://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystoneauth/>`_ library for
authentication, so that it is possible to use any authentication plugin that is
available there (so starting on version 1.0 of cASO it is possible to use the
Keystone V3 API).

.. important::
   You need to specify the ``auth_type`` that you want to use (normally
   ``v3password`` is a good choice.

   For an exhaustive list of available plugins please refer to the
   `keystoneauth <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystoneauth/plugin-options.html#available-plugins>`_
   documentation.

``[ssm]`` section
-----------------

Options defined here configure the SSM messenger. There is only one option
at the moment:

* ``output_path`` (default: ``/var/spool/apel/outgoing/openstack``), directory
  to put the generated SSM records. APEL/SSM should be configured to take
  records from that directory.

``[logstash]`` section
----------------------

Options defined here configure the `logstash <https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash>`_
messenger. Available options:

* ``host`` (default: ``localhost``), host of Logstash server.
* ``port`` (default: ``5000``), Logstash server port.

Other cASO configuration options
--------------------------------

For an exhaustive list of the defined options, please check the following page:

Additional (optional) configurations
====================================

Publishing benchmark information for OpenStack flavors (optional)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

cASO is able to publish benchmark information included in the accounting
recors, in order to do CPU normalization at the accounting level.

In order to do so, you need to add this information to the flavor properties
and configure caso to retrieve this information. There are two different values
that need to be added to the flavor

.. list-table:: Default flavor properties used by cASO to publish benchmark
   information
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Value

   * - ``accounting:benchmark_name``
     - Benchmark name (e.g. HEPSPEC06)

   * - ``accounting:benchmark_value``
     - Benchmark value (e.g. 99)

For example, if you are using HEPSPEC06 and the benchmark value is ``99`` for
the flavor ``m1.foo``, the benchmark information is configured as follows::

    openstack flavor set --property accounting:benchmark_name="HEPSPEC06" --property accounting:benchmark_value=99 m1.foo

Using different keys to specify bechmark information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you do not want to use cASO's default flavor properties
``accounting:benchmark_name`` and ``accounting:benchmark_value`` (for example
because you are using different benchmark types and values) you can specify
which properties ``cASO`` should look for by using the ``name_key`` and
``value_key`` in the ``[benchkmark]`` section of the configuration file.

.. important::

    Please note that there is an OpenStack scheduler filter that removes hosts
    based on flavor properties. In order to not interfere with the behaviour of
    this filter you must prefix the property with a ``scope:`` so that cASO's
    properties are not taken into account for this filtering. When adding these
    properties in cASO's configuration file, please include the complete name
    (i.e. ``scope:property``).

.. important:: Option deprecation

    Please bear in mind that the old options ``benchmark_name_key`` and
    ``benchmark_value_key`` in the ``[DEFAULT]`` configuration option are
    marked as deprecated. Please update your configuration file as soon as
    possible to avoid warnings.

Publishing accelerator information for OpenStack accelerators (optional)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting with cASO >= 3.0.0 it is possible to publish accelerator information
using a new accounting record.

In order to do so, you need to add this information to the flavor properties
and configure caso to retrieve this information. There are different values
that need to be added to the flavor:

.. list-table:: Default flavor properties used by cASO to publish accelerator
   information
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Flavor Property
     - Value

   * - Accelerator:Type
     - The accelerator type (e.g. GPU))

   * - Accelerator:Vendor
     - Name of the accelerator vendor (e.g. NVIDIA)

   * - Accelerator:Model
     - Accelerator model (e.g. V100)

   * - Accelerator:Number
     - Hoy many accelerators are available for that flavor (e.g. 2)

Using different keys to specify bechmark information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you do not want to use cASO's default flavor properties to publish the
existing accelerators, you can specify which properties ``cASO`` should look
for by using the ``type_key``, ``vendor_key``, ``model_key`` and ``number_key``
in the ``[acelerator]`` section of the configuration file.

.. important::

    Please note that there is an OpenStack scheduler filter that removes hosts
    based on flavor properties. In order to not interfere with the behaviour of
    this filter you must prefix the property with a ``scope:`` so that cASO's
    properties are not taken into account for this filtering. When adding these
    properties in cASO's configuration file, please include the complete name
    (i.e. ``scope:property``).
