# Specmatic Python
This is a Python library to run [Specmatic](https://specmatic.in).  
Specmatic is a contract driven development tool that allows us to turn OpenAPI contracts into executable specifications.

  The specmatic python library provides three main functions:
  - The ability to start and stop a python web app like flask/sanic.
  - The ability to run specmatic in test mode against an open api contract/spec.
  - The ability to stub out an api dependency using the specmatic stub feature.

#### Running Contract Tests
A contract test validates an open api specification against a running api service.  
The open api specification can be present either locally or in a [Central Contract Repository](https://specmatic.in/documentation/central_contract_repository.html)  
[Click here](https://specmatic.in/documentation/contract_tests.html) to learn more about contract tests.  

#### How to use
- Create a file called test_contract.py in your test folder.  
- Declare an empty class in it called 'TestContract'.
  Specmatic will use this class to inject tests dynamically into it when you run it via say PyTest.

## WSGI Apps

#### To run contract tests with a stub for a wsgi app (like Flask):  
- Create an instance of a ``````WSGIAppServer`````` by passing it your app object, host, port:  
``````app_server = WSGIAppServer(app, app_host, app_port)``````
- Note:
  - The host and port are optional. If they are not specified, the app will be started on a random available port on 127.0.0.1.
  - You would need a [specmatic.json](https://specmatic.in/documentation/specmatic_json.html) file to be present in the root directory of your project.
- To run tests using a stub for your dependencies:
``````
class TestContract:
    pass
    
    
app_server = WSGIAppServer(app, app_host, app_port)
Specmatic() \
    .with_project_root(PROJECT_ROOT) \
    .stub(stub_host, stub_port, [expectation_json_file]) \
    .app(app_server) \
    .test(TestContract) \
    .run()
`````` 

- In this, we are passing:
  - an instance of the WSGIAppServer class. 
  - an empty test class.
  - stub_host, stub_port, optional list of json files to set expectations on the stub.  
    The stub_host, stub_port will be used to run the specmatic stub server.   
    If they are not supplied, the stub will be started on a random available port on 127.0.0.1.    
    [Click here](https://specmatic.in/documentation/service_virtualization_tutorial.html) to learn more about stubbing/service virtualization.
-  You can run this test from either your IDE or command line by pointing pytest to your test folder:
   ``````pytest test -v -s``````  
- NOTE: Please ensure that you set the '-v' and '-s' flags while running pytest as otherwise pytest may swallow up the console output.
  

#### To run contract tests without a stub:

``````
class TestContract:
    pass
    
    
app_server = WSGIAppServer(app, app_host, app_port)
Specmatic() \
    .with_project_root(PROJECT_ROOT) \
    .app(app_server) \
    .test(TestContract) \
    .run()
``````                        

## ASGI Apps

#### To run contract tests with a stub for an asgi app (like sanic):
- Create an instance of a ``````ASGIAppServer`````` by passing it a string in the 'module:app' format for your asgi app, host, port:  
``````app_server = ASGIAppServer('main:app', app_host, app_port)``````  
 If host and port are not specified, the app will be started on a random available port on 127.0.0.1.
- You can now use the ``````ASGIAppServer`````` object to run tests just like we do it for WSGI apps:
``````
class TestContract:
    pass
    
    
app_server = ASGIAppServer('main:app', app_host, app_port)
Specmatic() \
    .with_project_root(PROJECT_ROOT) \
    .stub(stub_host, stub_port, [expectation_json_file]) \
    .app(app_server) \
    .test(TestContract) \
    .run()
``````

## Common Issues
- **'Error loading ASGI app'** 
   This error occurs due to incorrect module being specified in the app module parameter 'module:app' string.
 
   #### Solutions:
   - Try to identify the correct module in which your app variable is instantiated/imported.  
     For example if your 'app' variable is declared in main.py, try passing 'main:app'.  
   - Try running the app using uvicorn directly:  
     `````` uvciron 'main:app' ``````  
     If you are able to get the app started using uvicorn, it will work with specmatic too.
