**DeepOD** is an open-source python framework for deep learning-based anomaly detection on multivariate/time-series data. DeepOD provides unified implementation of different detection models based on PyTorch.


DeepOD includes 13 deep outlier detection / anomaly detection algorithms (in unsupervised/weakly-supervised paradigm) for now. More baseline algorithms will be included later.


ðŸ”­ *We are working on a new feature -- by simply setting a few parameters, different deep anomaly detection models can not only handle different data types.*   

- We have finished some attempts on partial models like Deep SVDD, DevNet, Deep SAD, PReNet and DIF. These models can use temporal networks like LSTM, GRU, TCN, Conv, Transformer to handle time series data. 
- *Future work*: we also want to implement several network structure, so as to processing more data types like graphs and images by simply plugging in corresponding network architecture. 


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DeepOD framework can be installed via:


.. code-block:: bash


    pip install deepod


install a developing version (strongly recommend)


.. code-block:: bash


    git clone https://github.com/xuhongzuo/DeepOD.git
    cd DeepOD
    pip install .

Usages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


DeepOD can be used in a few lines of code. This API style is the same with sklearn and PyOD.


.. code-block:: python


    # unsupervised methods
    from deepod.models.dsvdd import DeepSVDD
    clf = DeepSVDD()
    clf.fit(X_train, y=None)
    scores = clf.decision_function(X_test)

    # weakly-supervised methods
    from deepod.models.devnet import DevNet
    clf = DevNet()
    clf.fit(X_train, y=semi_y) # semi_y uses 1 for known anomalies, and 0 for unlabeled data
    scores = clf.decision_function(X_test)
