Your `Api` will receive and return JSON.\n\n✅ Markdown and Html support with live reload: experiment an smooth frontend devserver experience without leaving your backend code with familiar syntax, `render_template` and `markdown_it` functions enable you to render static markdown files and html jinja templates with live reload.\n\n✅ Inspired by fastapi, you will work with almost the same syntax and features like path operations, path parameters, query parameters, request body, status codes, `/docs` automatic interactive API documentation, and decorated view functions and automatic serialization and deserialization of your data.\n\n💡 With aiofauna, you can build fast, scalable, and reliable modern applications, avoiding decision fatigue and focusing on what really matters, your data and your business logic.\n\n📚 Check out the aiofauna library, and start building your next-gen applications today! 🚀\n\n#Python #FaunaDB #Async #Pydantic #aiofauna\n\n⚙️ If you are using a synchronous framework check out [Faudantic](https://github.com/obahamonde/faudantic) for a similar experience with FaunaDB and Pydantic.\n\n📚 [Documentation](https://obahamonde-aiofauna-docs.smartpro.solutions) (Built with aiofauna)\n\n📦 [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/aiofauna/)\n\n📦 [Demo](https://aiofauna-fwuw7gz7oq-uc.a.run.app/) (Whatsapp clone built with aiofauna)\n\n📦 [Swagger UI](https://aiofauna-fwuw7gz7oq-uc.a.run.app/docs) (Whatsapp clone built with aiofauna)\n\n📦 [GitHub](https://github.com/obahamonde/aiofauna)\n",
