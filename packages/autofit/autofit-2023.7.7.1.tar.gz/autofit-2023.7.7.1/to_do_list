__Documentation__

- In this section, include docs on writing and loading models / collections with jsons and adding them together.
- Include docs on the Dictable object from autoconf.
- Model Collection addition not working?
- Animation of 1D Gaussian fitting.
- Need to add model cookbook script for MGE style models, add link to readthedocs overview. Use example of many 1D gaussians, with images
- Add image example to every cookbook showing the 1D gaussian model we are composing for.

__Complaints__

- Explicit exampels of how to extend Analsyis (e.g. putting extra data in c0nstructor) for Python beginners.
- Amy was unsure how to use an instance to plot a new component. Show an example where an instance is used


__Logging__

- More logging for improved debugging, with customzized level of output.
- Warning customization.

__Samples__

 - Have as_instance=True default argument in all Samples objects. Use decorator to implement the output.


__Searches__

- optimize -> mle.
- New MLE fits with eye on sensitivity mapping.
- LBFGS: Limits on parameters, callback history.
- New nested / MCMC routines.


__Output Customization__

- Rich: Customize how output results are, interface with database (e.g ML only, sigma values only).
- Mass visualization for database runs in single folder.
- Pickle customization.
- Database tutorials.


__Database__

- Informative error message explaining why a database fit doesnt work due to version mismatch, pointing to a GitHub page explaining this.
- Database: profiling tests, speed ups and tools. Use test mode to quickly generate large result libearies.
- Database Storage, not needing full Dynesty etc, only store basics, no properties so we can remake each object.


__Graphical Models__

- Graphical models: model.info file, on-the-fly summary file, output of KL divergence / evidence in factors,
  model.results of overall model. For output, include a single file which is the latest results and a folder with
  all factor results, tilted, etc. FactorGraphResult.
