Module bground.bfunc
--------------------
Functions for background calculation.

* The functions are usually called from bground.iplot module.
* The bground.iplot module defines interactive plot and its events.
* This module defines functions that perform the real background calculation.

def sort_bkg_points(bkg):
    '''
    Sort background points according to their X-coordinate.
    The background points are inserted as the whole bkg object.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    bkg : bground.bdata.bkg object
        A bkg object containing unsorted list of background points.

    Returns
    -------
    None; the output is bkg object with sorted background points.

def calculate_background(data,bkg):
    '''
    Calculate background
    = calculate interpolated background curve;
    the calculated background curve is saved within bkg object.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    bkg : bground.bdata.bkg object
        Object containing the following items:
            * basename = string, basename of output file(s)
            * points = 3-column list: [PointType, X-coord, Y-coord]
            * itype = type of interpolation for the calculation of bkground
    
    Returns
    -------
    None; the result is the updated bkg object.
        * bkg.X = calculated X-coordinates of the WHOLE background
        * bkg.Y = calculated Y-coordinates of the WHOLE background

    Subtract background
