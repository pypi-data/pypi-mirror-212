file-contents:
  releasenotes/notes/Add-called_once-property-a69546448cbd5542.yaml:
    features:
    - A called_once property was added to the adapter and the mocker. This gives us
      an easy way to emulate mock's assert_called_once.
    prelude: 'Add a called_once property to the mockers.

      '
  releasenotes/notes/Add-py.typed-file-5a5cae1041dd0859.yaml:
    fixes:
    - A py.typed file is required to enable type annotations for the package. Add
      to pack for re-release.
  releasenotes/notes/Allow-pickling-response-fe751b0a760a5001.yaml:
    fixes:
    - Remove weakref objects from the request/response that will allow the objects
      to be pickled with the regular python mechanisms.
  releasenotes/notes/Bump-minimum-requests-2.3-70fd287f6ea1a12e.yaml:
    critical:
    - 'The minimum version of requests has been increase to 2.3. This simply

      ensures that all documented features of requests-mock are actually

      available. This version of requests is still quite old and if this is an

      issue you should either pin requests-mock to <1.6 or preferably update

      requests.

      '
    prelude: 'Increase the minimum required requests version to 2.3

      '
  releasenotes/notes/Fix-urlquote-of-quoted-path-84cc1ff122dba279.yaml:
    fixes:
    - As part of 1.9.0 we started quoting unsafe URL characters. This was done incorrectly
      that meant we requoted existing quoted strings. Fixes
  releasenotes/notes/RLock-around-send-8adf0487b887f378.yaml:
    fixes:
    - 'In some multithreading situations the mocker might try and replace an

      already patched object from a different thread. To make this thread safe we

      will put a lock around the mocker so that only one thread can work with the

      mocker at any time. This has to be a reentrant lock as the same thread can

      go through it multiple times.

      '
  releasenotes/notes/Set-JSON-Encoder-31889bc42d11b7d3.yaml:
    features:
    - 'You can now set the JSON encoder for use by the json= parameter on either

      the mocker or an individual mocked response. This will make it easier to

      work with systems that encode in a specific way.

      '
  releasenotes/notes/Support-Type-Hints-0f7d2385bd808d84.yaml:
    features:
    - Add python type hints for python 3.
  releasenotes/notes/Type-Annotation-Fixes-121a274d75791a61.yaml:
    fixes:
    - 'A series of type hint fixes, most importantly the register_uri return value
      is not a response but a usable Matcher object.

      '
  releasenotes/notes/Update-type-annotations-3314fbc6e7552750.yaml:
    fixes:
    - Improvements to some type annotations that were making it confusing to use the
      library in an IDE.
  releasenotes/notes/add-reset-function-bcef01162cab0912.yaml:
    features:
    - 'Add a reset/reset_mock function to the mocker and components so that users

      can clear the calls and history from the Mocker without clearing all the

      matching that has been used.

      '
  releasenotes/notes/additional-matcher-5c5cd466a6d70080.yaml:
    features:
    - Allow specifying an `additional_matcher` to the mocker that will call a function
      to allow a user to add their own custom request matching logic.
  releasenotes/notes/case-insensitive-matching-a3143221359bbf2d.yaml:
    features:
    - You can pass case_sensitive=True to an adapter or set `requests_mock.mock.case_sensitive
      = True` globally to enable case sensitive matching.
    fixes:
    - Reported in bug \#1584008 all request matching is done in a case insensitive
      way, as a byproduct of this request history is handled in a case insensitive
      way. This can now be controlled by setting case_sensitive to True when creating
      an adapter or globally.
    prelude: 'It is now possible to make URL matching and request history not lowercase
      the provided URLs.

      '
    upgrade:
    - It is recommended you add `requests_mock.mock.case_sensitive = True` to your
      base test file to globally turn on case sensitive matching as this will become
      the default in a 2.X release.
  releasenotes/notes/explicit-nesting-behaviour-4d28c310dc4c463a.yaml:
    features:
    - 'Nested mocks now has a defined behaviour which is essentially a classic

      nesting behaviour. A mock works as normal, but in the same way that

      real_http=True will escalate to the outer send (typically the real send) if

      there is a mocker defined outside that will handle the calls.

      '
    fixes:
    - 'This fixes all known nesting bugs. They may not be perfect, however this is

      now the explicit defined behaviour and so all related bugs are closed in

      favour of this.

      '
    prelude: 'Makes explicit the behaviour of nested mocking.

      '
  releasenotes/notes/fix-iter-content-none-1e29754a75273b8c.yaml:
    fixes:
    - 124 when using `response.iter_content(None)` the iterator would keep returning
      b'' and never finish. In most code paths the b'' would indicate that the stream
      is finished, but using None we have to close it ourselves.
  releasenotes/notes/fix-pytest-version-discovery-43f27e7e162ed055.yaml:
    fixes:
    - Fixed a bug relating to how the pytest version was being discovered that meant
      new versions of pytest were being treated as old versions and would receive
      bad configuration.
  releasenotes/notes/fix-zero-bytes-read-109628b72221cfe7.yaml:
    fixes:
    - Issue 144 - When performing a read we handled an empty byte return as an indication
      to close the file pointer. This is not true when you actually ask for a zero
      byte read so we should allow it.
  releasenotes/notes/fixture-extras-699a5b5fb5bd6aab.yaml:
    features: Added 'fixture' to pip extras so you can install the fixture requirements
      with `pip install requests-mock[fixture]`
    prelude: 'Installing the requirements for the ''fixture'' contrib package can
      now be done via pip with `pip install requests-mock[fixture]`

      '
  releasenotes/notes/match-empty-query-string-e6d6976fe002da0b.yaml:
    features:
    - You can now match on the empty query string value like `/path?a`.
  releasenotes/notes/pin-requests-version-e0f090aa31dc86c3.yaml:
    fixes:
    - 'Pins version of requests to <3 to prepare for new release of requests in future.

      '
  releasenotes/notes/public-type-aliases-f389506932adfa2c.yaml:
    features:
    - "Exposes some public type aliases (for type hinting only, they can't be instanciated)\
      \ \nfor the types intended to be used by `requests_mock` users. \nThe following\
      \ types are now exposed:\n- `requests_mock.Context` used in callbacks\n- `requests_mock.Request`\
      \ used in callbacks, which is a `requests.PreparedRequest` proxy.\n- `requests_mock.Callback[T]`\
      \ which is the callbacks type.\n"
    fixes:
    - "Some typing inconsistencies have been fixed. \nEspecially for `request` object\
      \ in signatures which is in fact a `requests_mock.Request` object.\n"
  releasenotes/notes/py.test-2-4e7735793288ea2d.yaml:
    fixes:
    - The py.test plugin was broken when using py.test < 3.0. The version of py.test
      that ships in EPEL is only 2.7 so we need to make sure we support at least that
      version.
    prelude: 'Fix py.test plugin with py.test < 3.0

      '
  releasenotes/notes/pytest-7e35da8c5f2cd428.yaml:
    features:
    - Added pytest fixture for native integration into pytest projects.
  releasenotes/notes/repo-move-15e956e1d54c048b.yaml:
    other:
    - 'In this release the main repository was moved off of OpenStack provided

      infrastructure and onto github at

      https://github.com/jamielennox/requests-mock. OpenStack has been a great

      home for the project however requests-mock is a general python project with

      no specific relationship to OpenStack and the unfamiliar infrastructure was

      limiting contributes from the wider community.

      '
    prelude: 'The primary repository is now at https://github.com/jamielennox/requests-mock

      '
  releasenotes/notes/request-history-stream-f1d75b33adcd7e97.yaml:
    features:
    - The stream parameter is recorded when the request is sent and available in request
      history in the same was as parameters like verify or timeout.
  releasenotes/notes/session-scoped-mock-7f1c98d9a91bffc8.yaml:
    features:
    - 'Allow mocking of only a single Session object. While there has always been

      the option of adding just the Adapter to an existing Session, this is more

      difficult to work with than the Mocker workflow that is typically used. You

      can now pass a Session object to a Mocker and it will provide the standard

      workflow but limited to just that object.

      '
  releasenotes/notes/set-default-response-reason-f24556261bc7e9e5.yaml:
    features:
    - When creating a response we now default the reason string to the appropriate
      string based on the status code. This can still be provided manually.
  releasenotes/notes/set-real-http-on-mocker-01eb26b65697466d.yaml:
    features:
    - 'Make real_http variable on Mocker object public. This means you can change

      the value of the parameter after the object has been created. This will

      allow setting it in situations like pytest where you may not be able to set

      __init__ time options.

      '
  releasenotes/notes/url-quote-path-a593190dee974a7a.yaml:
    fixes:
    - Fix [#148](https://github.com/jamielennox/requests-mock/issues/158). When you
      have a non url-safe character in your URL it is quoted by requests however requests-mock
      just treated it as a normal string.
  releasenotes/notes/urllib3-2-content-length-mismatch-d98e782a25c41266.yaml:
    fixes:
    - 'Fix incompatibility with urllib3 >2.0.0. In 2.0.0 they default to enforcing

      content length checking on returned bodies in responses from the previous

      default of false. However the flag is still available so for compatibility

      we can just default the other way.

      '
  releasenotes/notes/user-response-encoding-b2eea39404140164.yaml:
    fixes:
    - 'If you specified a charset in the Content-Type of a response it would be

      ignored and overriden with either ''utf-8'' or None depending on the type of

      response content passed in. If you pass this value we should honour it and

      perform the encoding correctly.
