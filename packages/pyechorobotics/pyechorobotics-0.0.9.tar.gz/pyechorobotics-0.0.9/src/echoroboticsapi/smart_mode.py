    Keeps track of which mode the robot is in.
    Unfortunately echoroboticsapi doesn't directly tell us this.
    But we can keep track ourselves and get some hints from last_statuses() and history_list().

    That is what this class does.
    To use, create an instance and register it with your api instance: your_api.register_smart_mode(your_smartmode)

    Keep making api requests to feed the SmartMode instance with data.
    Then you can call get_robot_mode() and get a decent guess.
