This is a Data subclass used to create pie charts. A pie chart can only
display one data series, and so this takes in a list of values and
labels directly unlike the Lines and Bars classes. Almost all
matplotlib pie chart key-word arguments are accepted, and information
about the plot legend should also be passed in, either upon creation
or set directly.

Pie.defaults shows a list of optional kwargs.
