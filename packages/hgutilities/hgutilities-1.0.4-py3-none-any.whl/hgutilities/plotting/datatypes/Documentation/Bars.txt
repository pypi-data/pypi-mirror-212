This is a subclass of Data used to create bar charts.
It takes in a bar object, or an iterable of bar objects,
and key-word arguments thar are relevant only to the entire
plot. If you wanted every data series to be the same color,
you would need to specify that for each bar object, but if
you wanted a log scale, you would specify that at this level.
If it does not make sense for two distinct data series to
have different values for a property, then it should be a
property of this object. For more detail, look at the
default values for Bars and Bar objects.

Bars.defaults shows a list of optional kwargs.
