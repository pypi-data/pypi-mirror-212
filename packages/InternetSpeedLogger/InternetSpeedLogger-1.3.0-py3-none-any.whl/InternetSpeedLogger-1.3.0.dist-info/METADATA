# InternetSpeedLogger

## Python Script for Testing the Speed of your Internet Connection

This Python script periodically tests the internet speed of your network and
logs the results in a CSV file. It uses the
[speedtest-cli](https://pypi.org/project/speedtest-cli/) library to measure
internet speed. You can control the frequency of testing and duration of the
entire test run via the script's parameters.

## Installation

Just install using pip:

```bash
pip install InternetSpeedLogger
```

## Usage

If you installed InternetSpeedLogger with pip, you should be able to simply
execute the script from anywhere:

```bash
InternetSpeedLogger
```

Type `InternetSpeedLogger --help` to get detailed execution information:

```
usage: InternetSpeedLogger [-h] [--version] [-i INTERVAL] [-d DURATION]
                           [-l LOG_FILE] [-no]

A Python script that continuously monitors and logs your internet
speed. It tests both download and upload speeds at regular intervals
and records the data in a CSV file for easy analysis and tracking.
Ideal for auditing your network performance or ISP reliability over
time.
            

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -i INTERVAL, --interval INTERVAL
                        Testing interval in seconds. Make sure that the
                        interval is not shorter than the time needed for
                        testing. (default: 60)
  -d DURATION, --duration DURATION
                        Duration of the entire test runs. The script will
                        automatically end after this duration. Set to <= 0 for
                        infinite. (default: 0)
  -l LOG_FILE, --log_file LOG_FILE
                        Filename for the log-file. NOTE: A similar filename
                        will be chosen if a file with this name already
                        exists.
  -no, --no_overwrite   Set this flag to automatically select a similar log-
                        filename, so a potentially already existing file will
                        not be overwritten.

Default location of the log-file:
    A .csv-file will be created, which will contain all logged information.
    Default Filename: "YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS_internet_speeds.csv"
    Default Location: <tmp_dir>/InternetSpeedLogger/
        <tmp_dir> on Windows: C:\TEMP, C:\TMP, \TEMP, or \TMP, in that order
        <tmp_dir> on all other: /tmp, /var/tmp, or /usr/tmp, in that order
```

## Sample Data

Below is a small sample of the data that will be logged in the CSV file by
InternetSpeedLogger:

| Timestamp         | Download (bps)    | Upload (bps)       | Datetime            | Download (Mbps) | Upload (Mbps) |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1686061579.679576 | 89643494.95465901 | 35883256.43988523  | 2023-06-06 16:26:19 | 90              | 36            |
| 1686061662.23925  | 89641818.67603663 | 36233910.883253716 | 2023-06-06 16:27:42 | 90              | 36            |
| 1686061721.562057 | 87986931.8695042  | 37110387.93753454  | 2023-06-06 16:28:41 | 88              | 37            |
| 1686061781.628893 | 91452820.98341656 | 37945852.74793821  | 2023-06-06 16:29:41 | 91              | 38            |
| 1686061841.479557 | 91453448.72492264 | 38497589.18734731  | 2023-06-06 16:30:41 | 91              | 38            |

Each row represents a single speed test with timestamp of when the test took
place, the download and upload speeds in bps and Mbps, and the formatted
datetime.

## Visualizing Data

Once you have accumulated a decent amount of data, you might want to visualize
it. Check out the
[InternetSpeedVisualizer](https://github.com/Andreas-Menzel/InternetSpeedVisualizer)
repository. This companion tool provides a suite of visualization options,
allowing you to uncover insights about your Internet speed over time.

Follow the instructions in its README to get started. Your data logging with
InternetSpeedLogger can now be taken to the next level with this visualization
tool!
