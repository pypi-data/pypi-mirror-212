# InternetSpeedLogger

## Python Script for Testing the Speed of your Internet Connection

This Python script periodically tests the internet speed of your network and
logs the results in a CSV file. It uses the
[speedtest-cli](https://pypi.org/project/speedtest-cli/) library to measure
internet speed. You can control the frequency of testing and duration of the
entire test run via the script's parameters.

## Installation

Just install using pip:

```bash
pip install InternetSpeedLogger
```

## Usage

If you installed InternetSpeedLogger with pip, you should be able to simply
execute the script from anywhere:

```bash
InternetSpeedLogger
```

Type `InternetSpeedLogger --help` to get detailed execution information:

```
usage: InternetSpeedLogger [-h] [--version] [-i INTERVAL] [-d DURATION]
                           [-l LOG_FILE]

A Python script that continuously monitors and logs your internet
speed. It tests both download and upload speeds at regular intervals
and records the data in a CSV file for easy analysis and tracking.
Ideal for auditing your network performance or ISP reliability over
time.
            

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -i INTERVAL, --interval INTERVAL
                        Testing interval in seconds. Make sure that the
                        interval is not shorter than the time needed for
                        testing. (default: 60)
  -d DURATION, --duration DURATION
                        Duration of the entire test runs. The script will
                        automatically end after this duration. Set to <= 0 for
                        infinite. (default: 0)
  -l LOG_FILE, --log_file LOG_FILE
                        Filename for the log-file. NOTE: ".csv" will be
                        automatically appended to the filename!

Default location of the log-file:
    A .csv-file will be created, which will contain all logged information.
    Default Filename: "YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS_internet_speeds.csv"
    Default Location: typically "/home/<username>" on Linux
                      typically "C:\Users\<username>" on Windows
                      typically "/Users/<username>" on macOS
```
