For the randomUserAgents parameter and the ``getSourceWithUserAgent`` function under the gatherInfo class, I got the user agents list from a project called slowloris which can be found on GitHub. Big credits to that list of user agents and the developer of slowloris as I used the list of user agents that the developer of slowloris used in this project.
