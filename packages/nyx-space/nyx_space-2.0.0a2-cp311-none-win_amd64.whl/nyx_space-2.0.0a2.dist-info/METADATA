# nyx
[Nyx](https://nyxspace.com) is a high fidelity, fast, reliable and **[validated]([https://nyxspace.com/MathSpec/](https://nyxspace.com/nyxspace/MathSpec/))** astrodynamics toolkit library written in Rust and available in Python.

The target audience is mission designers, astrodynamics engineers/hobbyists, and GNC engineers. The rationale for using Rust is to allow for very fast computations, guaranteed thread safety,
and portability to all platforms supported by [Rust](https://forge.rust-lang.org/platform-support.html).
