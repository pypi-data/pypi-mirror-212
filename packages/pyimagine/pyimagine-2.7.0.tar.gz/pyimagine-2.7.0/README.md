PyImagine is a Python library for AI-powered image manipulation. It provides a simple interface to interact with an
image manipulation service, allowing you to perform various operations on images.

## Features

- Generate inspired images based on predefined prompts and styles.
- Apply variations to images based on prompts, strengths, and styles.
- Enhance image resolution and quality using AI-powered upscaling.
- Generate prompts based on the content of images.
- Fill in missing or corrupted parts of images.
- Remix images by applying control prompts, strengths, and styles.
- Fix and enhance facial features in images.

## Installation

You can install PyImagine using pip:

````shell
pip install pyimagine
````

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use PyImagine:

````python
from pyimagine import Imagine
from pyimagine.constants import Inspiration

# Initialize Imagine
imagine = Imagine()

# Generate an inspired image
inspired_image = imagine.inspire(Inspiration.INSPIRATION_01)

# Variate an image
original_image = open("image.jpg", "rb").read()
variated_image = imagine.variate(original_image, prompt="Create something amazing!")

# Upscale an image
upscaled_image = imagine.upscale(original_image)

# And more...
````

the [documentation](https://github.com/hyugogirubato/pyimagine/blob/main/docs).

### Exceptions

The following exceptions can be raised by PyImagine:

- `InvalidWord`: Raised when a banned word is found in the prompt. By default, if the `restricted` flag is set to `True`
  during initialization, the library will raise an `InvalidWord` exception. You can customize this behavior by setting
  `restricted` to `False` to replace banned words with alternative words instead of raising an exception.
