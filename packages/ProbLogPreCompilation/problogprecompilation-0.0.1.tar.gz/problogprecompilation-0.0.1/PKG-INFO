# PreCompilation

This project allows the use of PreCompilation of ProbLog, which can be useful when trying to perform queries on ProbLog 
with the same logic rules but different knowledge bases.

It can also be used in a Markov Chain scenario by providing the output of the last operation back into the system.

For examples on how to use this system, check [examples](examples).
