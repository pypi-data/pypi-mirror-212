django-postgres-metrics was originally created in 2017 by Markus Holtermann.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made django-postgres-metrics that much
better:

    Markus Holtermann <https://markusholtermann.eu>
    Dusty Phillips <dusty@buchuki.com>
    Thibaud Colas <https://github.com/thibaudcolas>
