# Project's description
**`scientific_tools` is the Swiss army knife of scientists, researchers, engineers and students who work with python.**

This document shows most important functionalities of this framework.

*This framework is currently in development, but most of functionnalities works without any bugs. When a functonality isn't stable or had known bugs, it was wrote in italic.*

# Mathematics

## Solve
The `scientific_tools.mathematics.solve` package can resolve equations with some functions using different algorithm :
- `dichotomy` function search the unique solution of f(x) = 0, where f is an continuous and strictly monotone function.
- `implicit_finite_difference_solver` function can solve a partial differential equation with the implicit finite difference method. The shape of partial differential equation must be Ctt Utt + Ctx Uxt + Cxx Uxx + Cx Ux + Ct Ut + Cu U = Cc.

*NB: This solver is experimental and it has been deprecated because of bugs.*
- `explicit_finite_difference_solver` function can solve the same shape of partial differential equation but with the explicit finite difference method.

*NB: This solver is experimental and it has been deprecated because of bugs.*

# Physics

## Uncertainty
The `scientific_tools.physics.uncertainty` package can calculate uncertainties :
- calculate standard uncertainties with propagation rules
- calculate relative uncertainties with propagation rules
- calculate z-scores (z-core between a value and a reference value & z-score between two value)

## Spectral analysis
The `scientific_tools.physics.spectral_analysis` package can calculate some Discrete Fourier Transforms. It can calculate frequencies of spectrum, and Discrete Fourier Transforms's coefficients, amplitudes and phases.

# Graphics package

## Functions graphs
The `scientific_tools.graphics.function_graphs` package can trace 2D and 3D functions graphs.

## Uncertainty graphs
The `scientific_tools.graphics.uncertainty_graphs` package can draw :
- an uncertainty graph with a function, the function plus its uncertainty and the fonction minus its uncertainty.
- experimental values with uncertainties bar.
- a z-score graph : draws the points (or a function) that correspond to z-score and draws the maximum and minimum lines of z-core validity.

## Spectral analysis graphs
The `scientific_tools.graphics.spectral_analysis_graphs` package can draw :
- graphs with amplitudes of Discrete Fourier Transform
- spectral graphs with phases of Discrete Fourier Transform

## Thanks
This framework rely on few others frameworks that are free.
The code is written in Python 3.11 and use :
- numpy
- matplotlib
