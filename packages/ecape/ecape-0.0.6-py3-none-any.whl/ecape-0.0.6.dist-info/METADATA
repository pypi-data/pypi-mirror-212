# ecape

ecape is a simple module that contains an entraining CAPE, or ECAPE, calculation described by Peters et. al. 2023.
Additionally, Peters-provided MatLab scripts serve as a reference and test verification data.
The module leans heavily on MetPy for meteorological calculations.

## Installation & Use

In console:

```console
pip install ecape
```

See the example in linked documentation.

```python
   from ecape.calc import calc_ecape
   ...
   ecape = calc_ecape(height, pressure, temperature, specific_humidity, u_wind, v_wind, cape_type)
```

Questions, comments, and feedback are certainly welcome. This project is a personal exercise
in learning how to publish packages to Github & PyPI, so excuse the excessive documentation for
one function.

### Future Work
 - add support for other water content variables
 - if useful, incorporate into MetPy
 - provide cli .nc, .csv, & aws support

### Disclaimer
There is a ~10% difference in ECAPE between calc_ecape and Peters' published matlab scripts. 
This is primarily due to a difference in calculated CAPE. The tests describe other sources of error (~1%).

Since:
 - the methods here are within ~1% of Peters' calculations when CAPE is equivalent in the sample data
 - Peters et. al. specifically mention MetPy for determining CAPE
 - MetPy is a reliable, open-source, and frequently used meteorological calculation package

MetPy's CAPE calculations were chosen for ease of readability and implementation.

If users prefer their own CAPE calculations, use the `manual_cape` parameter to override this decision!
