Splathash
=========

A Django USSD framework package.

Requirements
------------

- Python 3.8+
- Django 4.2, 4.1, 4.0, 3.2

We **highly recommend** and only officially support the latest patch release of
each Python and Django series.

Installation
------------

1. Install using `pip`...

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install splathash

2. Add "splathash" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this:

    .. code-block:: python

        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            ...,
            "splathash",
        ]

3. Include the splathash URLconf in your project urls.py like this:

    .. code-block::

        path("splathash/", include("splathash.urls")),

4. Run ``python manage.py migrate`` to apply migrations.

5. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/splathash/playground/
   to test your USSD endpoint (you'll need to login with a user in the admin panel first).

Contributing and development
----------------------------

1. To start contributing to **Splathash**, clone the repository's develop branch:

    .. code-block:: bash

        git clone -b develop https://github.com/nalo-solutions/splathash

2. Create a virtual env with all development dependencies.

    .. code-block:: bash

        cd splathash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt

3. In the main project directory, you'll find the `splathash` folder, which serves as both the main package itself and a Django app within the `testproject` Django project. Additionally, the `testapp` is another Django app within the `testproject` setup.
This project is designed to facilitate testing of the `splathash` package within a Django project. To run the development server, use the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        python manage.py runserver

4. Run the tests with:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pytest

Committing your code
--------------------

Before committing please make sure you have installed the `pre-commit` hooks in your local git repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    pre-commit install

This will ensure that your code is cleaned before you commit it.

Creating releases
-----------------

1. Update the version number with this command(Replace <part> with the part of the version you want to increment. For example: *patch, minor or major*):

    .. code-block:: bash

        bump2version <part>

2. Merge new a release into main to trigger the workflow.
