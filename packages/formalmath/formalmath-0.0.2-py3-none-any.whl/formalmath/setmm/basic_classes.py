'''
Python port for a slightly extended version of the formal language metamath (us.metamath.org) and the theorem database set.mm written by metamath. This system includes over 40000 theorems in the classic ZFC axiom system.

The basic classes will be defined in this file. That includes:
0. MObject. The base class for all classes.
1. Constant. That correspond to $c statement in metamath.
2. Variable. That correspond to $v statement in metamath.
3. FormulaTemplate. That correspond to $a statements starting with wff symbol. Basically, it generates new formula from old. But the template can also have Constant, ClassVariable, SetVariable, etc.
4. Formula. That correspond to wff in metamath and set.mm. It is not a part of the basic metamath language. But it is defined in set.mm to denote well formed formula. There is always new ways to form a wff, when a new term is introduced. But all of them correspond to a conbination of old terms.
5. ClassVariable. That correspond to class in metamath and set.mm.
6. SetVariable. That correspond to setvar in metamath and set.mm.
7. Axiom. That correspond to $a statements that are axioms.
8. Definition. That correspond to $a statements that are definitions.

Some basic constants will be defined here too, such as left and right parenthesis, well-formed formula symbol and turnstile.
