# FireGS

FireGS is a command-line tool for managing Firebase Android Apps. It allows you to create new apps and list all apps in your Firebase project.

## Installation

You can install FireGS using pip:

```bash
pip install firegs
```

You will also need to provide the path to your Firebase service account key file. You can do this by running the `firegs` command:

```bash
firegs
```

This will prompt you for the path to your service account key file.

## Usage

To create a new Firebase Android app, run the `firegs` command with the `-c` flag followed by the package name of the new app. You can also provide a display name for the app with the `-d` flag:

```bash
firegs -c com.example.app -d "Example App"
```

To list all Firebase Android apps in your project, run the `firegs` command with the `-l` flag:

```
firegs -l
```
